Learning Outcomes
* Apply selective focus to demonstrate depth of field
* Effect on Exposure
	* Shutter Speed
		* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007225808.png)
	* Aperture
		* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007225824.png)
* Equivalent Exposure
	* Different combinations of shutter speed, aperture, and ISO settings can result in the same amount of light reaching the sensor.

* Why do these three photos have the same brightness (exposure)?
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007230107.png)
	* Manual Mode
		* To keep equivalent exposure, when you make the Aperture smaller, you must make Shutter Speed longer to keep the same amount of light.
* What is Depth of Field?
	* Area of sharpness or focus (from near to far) within a photograph
	* 3 factors affect Depth of Field?
		* Aperture: Diameter of the lens opening (most important)
		* Focal Length (zoom): of the lens you are using
		* Subject: Distance between the camera and subject
	* Shallow DOF
		* More background blur
			* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007230425.png)
		* Deep DOF
			* Less (or no) background blur

* How aperture affects depth of field
	* [[Large Apertures (f/2.8, f/4, f5.6)]]
		* Used to isolate or focus attention on a singular subject.
		* The area in front and behind the subject will be blurry because it is not in focus.
		* All the attention in the frame is focused on the subject.
		* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007230711.png)
	* [[Medium apertures (f/8, f/11)]]
		* Gives you a medium Depth of Field. 
		* f8 is ideal for Street photography because it’s the best combination of enough depth of field (everything in focus) and fast enough shutter speed.
		* f16 would not let enough light to get a good exposure.

	* [[Small apertures (f/16, f/22, f/32)]]
		* Give a deeper depth of field. 
		* Landscape photographs require a deeper depth of field....
		* You want the area of focus to reach from close to the camera all the way the far distance of the landscape.
* How subject distance affect Depth of Field?
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007231133.png)
* Focus close to camera = [[Shallow DoF]]
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007231218.png)
* Focus far from camera = [[Deeper DoF]]
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007231250.png)
* How Focal Length affects Depth of Field
	* Focal Length = Distance in millimeters from the center of a lens to the image sensor
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007231430.png)
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007231443.png)
* The more you zoom your lens the blurrier the background gets
	* Aperture and point of focus stay the same
	  ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007231518.png)
	* Subject Close
		* When your subject is closer to your camera, the DoF is around 50/50 in front and behind your subject.
	* Subject Far
		* When your subject is further from your camera, the DoF is around 1/3 in front and 2/3 behind.
* Depth of Field is measured in front of and behind the ‘point of focus'

* Problem Examples
	* No tripod
		* Camera moves between shots
		* Camera shake - 1/40 sec is too slow shutter speed for hand-held
		* No tripod means they have to place camera on the fkiirs
	* Exposure changes between shots
	* Near and Far objects too close together
		* Make it hard to see the difference in depth of field
