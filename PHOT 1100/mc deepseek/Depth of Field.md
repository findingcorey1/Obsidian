### Multiple Choice Questions: Depth of Field & Equivalent Exposure

**1. What is the definition of Depth of Field (DOF)?**
A) The distance between the camera and the closest object in focus
B) The area of sharpness or focus from near to far within a photograph
C) The speed at which the lens can achieve focus
**D) The measurement of background blur intensity**

**2. Which three factors directly affect Depth of Field?**
A) Shutter speed, ISO, and white balance
**B) Aperture, focal length, and subject distance**
C) Lens brand, sensor size, and image stabilization
D) Lighting conditions, file format, and camera mode

**3. In the concept of "Equivalent Exposure," what remains constant?**
A) The depth of field in the photograph
B) The amount of motion blur in the image
**C) The amount of light reaching the camera sensor**
D) The ISO setting

**4. To maintain equivalent exposure when you make the aperture smaller (e.g., from f/4 to f/8), what must you do with the shutter speed?**
A) Make it faster
**B) Make it longer/slower**
C) Keep it the same
D) Switch to bulb mode

A) Shallow depth of field
**B) Deep depth of field**
C) Variable depth of field
D) Selective depth of field

**7. How does moving your subject closer to the camera affect depth of field?**
A) It creates a deeper depth of field
B) It creates a shallower depth of field
C) It has no effect on depth of field
**D) It only affects background blur but not foreground sharpness**

**8. When using a longer focal length (zooming in), what happens to the depth of field?**
**A) It becomes deeper**
B) It becomes shallower

A) f/2.8
**B) f/8**
C) f/16
D) f/22

**10. What is the primary creative use of large apertures (like f/2.8 or f/4)?**
A) To maximize sharpness throughout the entire scene
**B) To isolate or focus attention on a singular subject with background blur**
C) To achieve the slowest possible shutter speed
D) To minimize camera shake in low light

**11. When your subject is far from the camera, how is the depth of field distributed around the point of focus?**
A) 50% in front and 50% behind the subject
B) 100% behind the subject
**C) Approximately 1/3 in front and 2/3 behind the subject**
D) Entirely in front of the subject

**12. What happens to depth of field as you zoom your lens to a longer focal length (assuming aperture and focus point remain the same)?**
A) The depth of field increases
B) The depth of field decreases
**C) The depth of field remains the same**
D) The depth of field becomes unpredictable

**13. Which setting has NO direct effect on depth of field?**
**A) Aperture**
B) Focal length
C) Shutter speed
D) Subject distance

**14. What is the relationship between aperture size and depth of field?**
A) Larger apertures (smaller f-numbers) create deeper depth of field
**B) Larger apertures (smaller f-numbers) create shallower depth of field**
C) Aperture size has no relationship to depth of field
D) Smaller apertures (larger f-numbers) create shallower depth of field

**15. When focusing very close to the camera, what characteristic does the depth of field typically have?**
A) It becomes deeper
B) It becomes shallower
C) It becomes evenly distributed front and back
D) It extends only behind the subject

**16. For a portrait where you want the subject's face sharp but the background blurry, which combination would be most effective?**
A) Small aperture (f/16) and wide lens
B) Large aperture (f/2.8) and telephoto lens
C) Small aperture (f/16) and telephoto lens
D) Large aperture (f/2.8) and wide lens

**17. In equivalent exposure, if you change your aperture from f/5.6 to f/11 (making it smaller), and want to maintain the same exposure, what should you do?**
A) Increase your shutter speed
B) Decrease your shutter speed
C) Increase your ISO
D) Change your focal length

**18. What is the primary reason f/16 would be problematic for street photography in normal daylight?**
A) It creates too much background blur
B) It doesn't let in enough light, requiring a slower shutter speed that might cause blur
C) It makes the depth of field too shallow
D) It causes excessive noise in the image

**19. When your subject is close to the camera, how is the depth of field distributed around the point of focus?**
A) Approximately 50% in front and 50% behind the subject
B) 100% behind the subject
C) Approximately 1/3 in front and 2/3 behind the subject
D) Entirely in front of the subject

**20. What problem might occur when trying to demonstrate depth of field differences without a tripod?**
A) The aperture settings won't work properly
B) The camera may move between shots, making comparisons difficult
C) The ISO will automatically adjust
D) The focal length will change unexpectedly
