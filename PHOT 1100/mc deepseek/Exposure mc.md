**7. If a photographer wants to freeze the motion of a running athlete, what type of shutter speed should they use?**  
A) A slow shutter speed, like 1/15

B) Focus  
C) Light

D) The lowest possible ISO setting

**10. What is the primary function of the camera's light meter?**  
A) To measure the distance to the subject

C) To automatically focus on the subject  
D) To set the white balance for the scene

**11. Why is Manual (M) mode considered the best for learning exposure?**  
A) Because it is the easiest and fastest mode to use.  
B) Because it gives the camera full control, ensuring perfect results.  
C) Because it gives you full control, making you think about the settings and teaching you the essential skill of exposure.  
D) Because it automatically brackets exposures for HDR images.

**12. What is the function of the diopter control on a camera?**  
A) It controls the aperture size.  
B) It changes the viewfinder's focus to match your eyesight.  
C) It adjusts the shutter speed.  
D) It sets the ISO sensitivity.

**13. In Aperture Priority (Av) mode, what does the photographer control?**  
A) The photographer chooses the shutter speed, and the camera chooses the aperture.  
B) The photographer chooses the aperture, and the camera chooses the shutter speed.  
C) The photographer controls both the aperture and shutter speed.  
D) The camera makes all exposure decisions.

**14. What is a general rule for using ISO?**  
A) Always use the highest ISO for the brightest images.  
B) Use the lowest ISO you possibly can to minimize noise.  
C) ISO should always be set to Auto.  
D) ISO only affects black and white images.

**15. Which factor does NOT influence depth of field?**  
A) Aperture  
B) Distance between camera and subject  
C) Shutter Speed  
D) Focal length

**16. If a scene is "overexposed," what has happened?**  
A) Not enough light has reached the sensor, resulting in a dark image.  
B) Too much light has reached the sensor, resulting in a too-bright image.  
C) The camera has focused on the wrong subject.  
D) The image has too much noise or grain.

**17. What is the primary consequence of a very slow shutter speed (e.g., 1/15 or slower)?**  
A) It will freeze all motion in the scene.  
B) It can create motion blur in the image.  
C) It will make the image underexposed.  
D) It will decrease the depth of field.

**18. In Shutter Priority (Tv) mode, what does the photographer control?**  
A) The photographer chooses the shutter speed, and the camera chooses the aperture.  
B) The photographer chooses the aperture, and the camera chooses the shutter speed.  
C) The photographer controls both the aperture and shutter speed.  
D) The camera makes all exposure decisions.

**19. The Bulb (B) shutter speed setting is used to:**  
A) Take the fastest possible photo.  
B) Hold the shutter open for as long as the shutter button is pressed.  
C) Automatically focus on a moving subject.  
D) Set the camera to its highest ISO.
