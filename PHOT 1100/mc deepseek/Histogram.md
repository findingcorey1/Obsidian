### Multiple Choice Questions: Histograms & Exposure

**1. What does a histogram visually represent?**  
**A) The color saturation levels in an image**  
==B) The number of pixels of each brightness in an image==  
C) The focus sharpness from foreground to background  
D) The white balance settings used

A) In the middle of the graph  
B) On the far right side  
**C) On the far left side**  
D) They are not shown on the histogram

**3. An image histogram shows a tall spike pressed against the far right edge. This indicates:**  
A) The image is properly exposed  
B) The image is underexposed and may lack shadow detail  
**C) The image is overexposed and may lack highlight detail**  
D) The image has low dynamic range

**4. What does the camera's exposure meter measure when determining exposure?**  
A) The specific colors in a scene  
**B) The luminosity, converting colors to tones of grey**  
C) The distance to the main subject  
D) The contrast ratio between foreground and background

**5. When photographing a predominantly white scene (like snow), what will a camera's light meter typically try to do?**  
A) Overexpose the scene to maintain bright whites  
B) Correctly expose for the white tones  
**C) Darken the exposure to make the scene 50% grey, resulting in underexposure**  
D) Increase the ISO to compensate for the brightness

**6. Why is a histogram particularly useful when reviewing images on a camera?**  
A) It shows the exact shutter speed and aperture used.  
**B) It can indicate if you are losing detail in shadows or highlights, which may be hard to see on the LCD screen.**  
C) It automatically corrects any white balance errors.  
D) It displays the specific colors that are over-saturated.

**7. What is "Dynamic Range" in photography?**  
A) The range of different colors a camera can capture  
**B) The measure of the range of brightness from dark to light that a camera can capture**  
C) The different focal lengths a lens can achieve  
D) The range of possible shutter speeds

**8. How does the dynamic range of a top mirrorless camera compare to the human eye?**  
A) It has a wider dynamic range than the human eye.  
B) It has approximately the same dynamic range as the human eye.  
**C) It has a narrower dynamic range than the human eye.**  
D) Its dynamic range is not measurable in stops.

**9. If a photographer chooses to "protect the highlights" in a high dynamic range scene, what is the likely consequence?**  
==A) The shadow areas may lose detail and become pure black.==  
B) The overall image will be perfectly exposed.  
**C) The highlight areas will become too dark.**  
D) The colors will become oversaturated.

**10. What does Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) do?**  
A) Automatically selects the best lens for the scene.  
**B) Takes a series of shots at different exposures without manual setting changes.**  
C) Merges multiple images in-camera to create a single HDR photo.  
D) Adjusts the focus throughout the scene automatically.

**11. A High Dynamic Range (HDR) image is created by:**  
A) Using a single, perfectly exposed photograph.  
B) Using a special lens with a very wide aperture.  
**C) Merging multiple bracketed exposures to cover both highlight and shadow areas.**  
D) Applying a specific color filter in post-processing.

**12. A histogram showing most pixels bunched in the middle tones with a balanced spread suggests:**  
A) A high-contrast, overexposed image  
**B) A low-contrast, properly exposed image**  
C) A high-contrast, underexposed image  
D) A low-contrast, underexposed image

**13. When photographing a dark subject on a dark background, the camera's meter will likely cause:**  
A) An underexposed image because it darkens the scene.  
B) A properly exposed image because it reads the subject accurately.  
**C) An overexposed image because it brightens the scene to 50% grey.**  
D) A high-contrast image because it increases the dynamic range.

**14. The concept of a camera capturing a "slice" of dynamic range refers to:**  
A) The photographer choosing which aspect ratio to use.  
**B) The photographer deciding whether to prioritize highlight or shadow detail.**  
C) The camera automatically selecting the ISO.  
D) The camera switching between JPEG and RAW formats.

**15. If a scene has very bright and very dark areas, it is said to have:**  
A) A low dynamic range  
**B) A high dynamic range**  
C) A balanced luminosity  
D) An incorrect white balance
