### Multiple Choice Questions: Capturing Motion

**1. What is the primary goal of a "Blur Motion" photograph?**
A) To have both the subject and background in sharp focus.
B) To have a blurred background and a sharp, frozen subject.
**C) To have a sharp, still background and a blurred moving subject.**
D) To create a zoom effect by moving the camera during exposure.

**2. Which shutter speed is most appropriate for "Freezing" a fast-moving subject?**
A) 1/4 second
B) 1/30 second
**C) 1/500 second or faster**
D) 2 seconds

**3. Why is a tripod strongly recommended for the "Blur Motion" technique?**
A) To allow the photographer to move with the subject.
**B) To ensure the static background remains in sharp focus.**
C) To help the camera autofocus more accurately on moving subjects.
D) To enable the use of a faster shutter speed.

**4. In the "Panning" technique, what is the desired visual outcome?**
**A) A sharp subject with a blurred background.**
B) A blurred subject with a sharp background.
C) Both the subject and background are blurred.
D) Both the subject and background are sharp.

**5. What is a major challenge of using a long shutter speed for a "Blur Motion" shot during the daytime?**
A) The image will be underexposed.
B) The camera's autofocus will fail.
**C) The image will be overexposed due to too much light.**
D) The colors will become less saturated.

**6. For the "Zoom" effect, what should you do with the lens during the exposure?**
A) Keep it at a fixed focal length.
**B) Smoothly zoom from the widest to the narrowest focal length (or vice versa).**
C) Rapidly jiggle the zoom ring back and forth.
D) Switch from manual focus to autofocus.

**7. Why is it suggested to photograph the "Freeze Motion" shot outdoors during the day?**
**A) Fast shutter speeds need more light, which is abundant in daylight.**
B) Slow shutter speeds work better in dark conditions.
C) The colors are more vibrant at night.
D) It is easier to use a tripod during the day.

**8. What shutter speed range is typically used for the "Panning" technique to create effective background blur?**
A) 1/500 sec or faster
**B) 1/30 or 1/20 sec**
C) 1/4 second or longer
D) Bulb mode for several minutes

**9. When setting up for a "Zoom" effect shot, what is a recommended step regarding focus?**
A) Use continuous autofocus throughout the exposure.
**B) Focus on your subject and then switch to manual focus to lock it.**
C) Set the focus to infinity.
D) Let the camera autofocus randomly during the zoom.

**10. According to the notes, what is a common problem with using cars as subjects for the "Panning" technique?**
A) They are too slow to create an effective blur.
==B) They are the least interesting subjects you can choose.==
**C) Their headlights always ruin the exposure.**
D) They require a shutter speed faster than 1/1000 sec.

**11. What is the key difference between "Blur Motion" and "Panning"?**
A) Blur Motion uses a fast shutter speed, while Panning uses a slow one.
B) Blur Motion requires a tripod, while Panning requires handholding the camera.
**C) In Blur Motion the background is sharp and the subject is blurred; in Panning the subject is sharp and the background is blurred.**
D) Blur Motion is for indoor use, while Panning is for outdoor use.

**12. For a "Freeze Motion" shot, what must the subject be in?**
A) A stationary, posed position.
B) A predictable, slow movement.
**C) An obvious state of motion.**
D) Complete darkness.

**13. Why is low light often better for achieving the "Zoom" effect?**
A) It allows for faster shutter speeds, which freeze the zoom action.
**B) It prevents overexposure when using long shutter speeds.**
C) It makes the autofocus system more accurate.
D) It enhances the colors in the final image.

**14. What is the purpose of switching to manual focus after achieving focus in the "Zoom" technique?**
A) To allow the photographer to manually blur the image.
**B) To prevent the camera from refocusing during the zoom, which could blur the subject.**
C) To make the zoom operation happen more smoothly.
D) To conserve battery power during the long exposure.

**15. If you change your shutter speed to freeze motion, what must you also adjust to maintain a correct exposure?**
A) The white balance setting.
**B) The aperture and potentially the ISO.**
C) The image file format (JPEG/RAW).
D) The focal length of the lens.

**16. What is a defining characteristic of a "Long Exposure" photograph?**
**A) The shutter is open for an extended period of time.**
B) It is always taken at night.
C) It uses the highest possible ISO setting.
D) The subject is always completely frozen.

**17. What is the main technical reason a "Freeze Motion" shot taken at night or indoors might fail?**
**A) The fast shutter speed required would let in too little light, resulting in an underexposed image.**
B) The slow shutter speed required would let in too much light, overexposing the image.
C) The autofocus systems in cameras do not work in the dark.
D) Camera shake is impossible to avoid in dark conditions.

**18. For the "Panning" technique, what lens setting is suggested to make the motion blur more obvious?**
**A) Zoom to the widest angle (e.g., 18mm).**
==B) Zoom to the narrowest focal length (e.g., 45mm).==
C) Use a macro lens for extreme close-ups.
D) Use a fisheye lens for distortion.

**19. Which of the following is NOT one of the four motion techniques listed for the assignment?**
A) Blur Motion
B) Freeze Motion
**C) Time Lapse**
D) Panning

**20. What is the overarching learning outcome for this assignment, beyond technical motion control?**
A) To master studio lighting setups.
**B) To use imagination and creativity and continue applying good composition.**
C) To learn advanced post-production editing techniques.
D) to specialize in nighttime photography.
