* Pixels (short for “picture elements)
* Every digital photograph …

Resolution
* Resolution is the measurement that determines how many pixels there are in a linear inch in an image
* PPI
	* Pixels per inch: the number of pixels per square inch in a digital file
* DPI
	* Dots per inch (printing) the number of dots of ink in a 1-inch square

What’s a Megapixel
* 1 Megapixel - 1 million pixels
* AMERA MANUFACTURERS DESCRUBE THE REOLUTION of their camera sensors in Megapixels
* Determined by multiplying the number of pixels in width and height of the sensor

EOS R100
* pixel diL
	* 24.1 Megapixel - 6000x4000

High Resolution
* 300 DPI
* 1inch x 1inch
* More pixels in square inch
* Need high resolution to make physical print of an image
* 
Lower Resolution
* 72 DPI/150DPI
* 1inch x 1inch
* Fewer pixels in a square inch
* Lower res
* ok for viewing on screen

DPI = Dots Per Inch

Resolution doesn’t matter when showing your photos on a screen
* Only important when printing an image

Cropping vs Resizing
* **Cropping** is cutting away part of the original image, discarding some of the pixels
* **Resizing** is changing the dimension of the image
* **Resizing image larger**: add pixel, which can result in a lose of quality, Excessive enlargement will produce blocky-looking and/or fuzzy pictures

Problems with resizing
* 2px x 2px 
* 4px x 4px 
* 16px x 16px

Why does image size matter when you print
* In general, good quality printers print at around 300 dpi this requires a large image with more pixels
* Your photo may look good on a phone screen but not when you print it
