- Basic lighting
    - Quality
        - Hard/soft Light
    - Direction
        - Location of light source in relation to background and subject
        - Direct or indirect onto subject
    - Source
        - Available light
        - added light
        - Primary light
        - Fill Light

- [[Hard/Soft Light]]
    - Identify quality of light by looking at shadow
    - 2 main factors
        - How big the light source is
        - Distance of light source to subject
    - Smaller the light source in relation to your subject, the harder it is
        - Ex. Sun
    - ![[Pasted image 20251008171948.png]]
	    - Direct Sun
	        - Small light source = hard light
	    - Sun through clouds
	        - Large light source = soft light

    - Diffused light
        - Shadow disappears
    - Hard light
        - Cast shadow w hard edge Straight Line - object → Shadow
        - Defined transition btw illumination and shadow
        - ![[Pasted image 20251008172137.png]]
    - Soft light
        - Wrap around subject
        - Subtle shadow w soft edges
        - Minimal transition btw illumination and shadow (Gradual Transition)

- Soft light great for portraiture
    - Soft light appear to wrap around your subject with a smooth transition from light to shadow, producing soft shadows
    - Allow subject to face …
- Hard light can be used for portrait
    - Denote strength darkness grittiness
    - Abrupt sharp transition between light and shadow, producing hard shadows and more contrast
- [[Direction]]
    - Angle/direction of where light is from
    - Light shining from behind the subject towards the camera creates a silhouette
    - ![[Pasted image 20251008172650.png]]
	- light from various directions, in the studio
		- ![[Pasted image 20251008172734.png]]
- [[Direct light]]
    - Falls form the source to the subject w/o any interference
    - Lighting diagrams
	    - ![[Pasted image 20251008172942.png]]
- [[Indirect]]
    - Reflect of a secondary surface
        - reflected off ceiling
        - ![[Pasted image 20251008173002.png]]
    - Diffused by a filter
        - Ex. Curtains
        - ![[Pasted image 20251008173018.png]]
    - reflected off the ceiling to light the room
- [[Source]]
    - Added/available light
        - Available light is what is already available in the spce
    - Added light is what you bring to the space
        - Usually artifical
    - Both can be either
        - Natural
            - Sun/moon
        - Artificial
            - lamps/flashes
    - Primary light source
        - Main source casting light on subject
    - Fill light
        - secondary weaker light source
        - fills in shadow
        - Use in bright sun to soften shadow

* [[Lowkey light]]
	* Light shining at certain angle to make a specific look
