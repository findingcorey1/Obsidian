# **5-Minute Presentation Script**

_(Based directly on your slides_ _)_

---

### **Slide 1 — Title Slide**

“Hello everyone, my name is Corey Li, and today I’ll be presenting my final project for PHOT 1100-001.  
For this project, I focused on an inspiration photographer and created three final images based on their style and techniques.”

---

### **Slide 2 — Inspiration: Chris Shonting**

“For my inspiration photographer, I chose **Chris Shonting**.  
Chris is a professional photographer who has been active since the mid-2000s, and he’s based in New York City. His work focuses heavily on **youth culture, music, and celebrity photography**.

What drew me to his work is the gritty yet clean aesthetic, and how he mixes natural environments with strong character-driven portraits.

Chris has shot campaigns for well-known brands like **Supreme** and **Peak Performance**, and he’s also written for magazines, including _New York Magazine’s The Cut_.”

### **Slide 3 — Research Photos**

“In researching Chris Shonting’s photography, I looked at 3–5 images that helped guide my project.

Some signature characteristics I noticed in his work include:

- Use of **natural light**, especially directional sunlight
    
- Strong **urban or outdoor settings**, often minimalistic
    
- Youth culture elements—streetwear, props, expressive poses
    
- A slightly cinematic or nostalgic tone
    

These qualities helped shape the concepts and approach I wanted to replicate in my own photos.”

### **Slide 4 — The Process**

“In planning my shoot, I tried to recreate the mood and structure of Shonting’s style.”  

**Props I used:**

- A toy gun
    
- Sunglasses
    
- Trail-like, rugged clothing such as Arc’teryx-style outfits
    
- A car as an environmental element
    

**Time of day:**

- I shot **during the day** to take advantage of natural light and the direction of the sun.
    
- I also shot **at night** to capture a darker, 90s-inspired mood similar to some of Shonting’s grittier portraits.
    

**Locations:**

- A concrete wall for a simple, solid background
    
- A parking lot with a car
    
- A forested area with trees and a puddle or small lake
    

These locations helped me recreate the mix of urban and natural settings that Shonting uses.”

### **Slide 5 — Final Photos**

“Here are my three final photos.”

### **Explanation of Techniques**

“To achieve these photos, I applied several techniques from the course:

1. **Lighting:**  
    I used natural light strategically—placing my subject so the sun created strong directional highlights or soft fill. This relates to what we learned about controlling shadows and using available light creatively.
    
2. **Composition:**  
    I used the rule of thirds, centered compositions, and leading lines depending on the environment. Shonting often keeps his backgrounds simple, so I did the same to keep attention on the subject.
    
3. **Color and Mood:**  
    I aimed for slightly muted, earthy tones in post-processing to match the rugged, outdoor aesthetic. At night, I let the low light and shadows create a moodier, nostalgic feeling.
    
4. **Posing and Expression:**  
    I tried to capture relaxed, natural poses—something Shonting does well to convey personality and authenticity.
    

Through this process, I learned how much small choices—like time of day, angle of light, or the presence of a prop—can dramatically shift the mood of a portrait.”

### **Conclusion**

“Overall, studying Chris Shonting helped me understand how to combine character-focused portraits with strong environmental choices. I enjoyed experimenting with natural light, exploring different locations, and building photos that feel stylized but still grounded.

Thank you, and I’m happy to answer any questions.”
