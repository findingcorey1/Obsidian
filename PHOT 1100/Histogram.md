* Learning Outcomes
	* Evaluate digital exposure using histograms
* What is a Histogram?
	* Bar chart hsowing you the number of pixels of each brightness in your image
	* Black is far left, White is far right

* How to read Histogram?

	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008002402.png)
	* [[Underexposed]]
		* NOt enough light to see parts of the image clearly
		* Spike at the left side of the graph means some of the image is under-exposed and may loose shadow detail
		* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008002450.png)
	* [[Overexposed]]
		* Too much light to see parts of image clearly
		* A Spike at the right side of the graph means you are over exposed and may loose highlight detail

* [[Exposure Meter]]
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008002644.png)
	* Meter can't see color
	* [[Luminosity]]
		* When measuring exposure, it converts the colors in a scene into tones of grey and emasures the bright
		* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008002704.png)
* If you are photographing a dark subject on dark background, what will the exposure meter try to do?
	* Brighten the exposure to get it to 50% grey
	* End up being overexposed
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008002750.png)
* If you are photographing a white subject on white background, what will the exposure meter try to do?
	* Darken the scene down to make everything 50% grey
	* end up underexposed
	* White comes out grey
* Why is Histogram useful?
	* show wether you are missing highlights or shadow details
	* LCD preview may not give accurate reading of the brightness of the image
	* Bright conditions you might not be able to see the LCD preview screen properly
* [[Dynamic Range]]
	* Every subject/scene you photograph has a dynamic range...
		* High Dynamic Range
			* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008003021.png)
		* Low Dynamic Range
			* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008003029.png)
	* Measure of the rankge of brightness (from dark to light) that a camera can display
	* Measured in stops
	* Each stop indicates a doubling or halving of the level of brightness captured
	* Human Eye DR
		* Human eyes have a range of 21 stops
	* Camera DR
		* No camera can see as much DR as Eye
		* Top Mirrorles has a Dynamic range of 10-14 stops
		* Have to choose which "slice" of dynamic range you want
			* Protect highlight
				* If you protect the highlights, then shadow detail falls to black
				* Shadow areas outside of dynamic range.
				* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251008003251.png)
			* Protect Shadows
				* Highlight detail is "blown out"
				* Highlight areas outside of dynamic range
* A scene with high Dynamic Range

* [[Automatic Exposure Bracket (AEB)]]
	* Take a number of shots as different exposure without having to manually change settings between frames
* [[High Dynamic Range (HDR)]]
	* Images merged together in camera to create HDR image
	* Four ‘bracketed’ images taken to cover both highlight and shadow areas of the scene.
