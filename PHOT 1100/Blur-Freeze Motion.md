Assignment Learning Outcomes
* Use your imagination & creativity to compose photographs that include an element of motion
* Apply various shutter speed and camera stabilization techniques to capture motion as frozen or blurred.
* Continue applying the principles of good composition. 

The effect of shutter speed on motion blur

* Common Shutter Speed

What does "[[Long Exposure]]" mean?
* Keeping shutter open for an extended period

Exposure modes on Digital Cameras
* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007222446.png)
* Equivalent exposure:
	* If you change your shutter speed, you will need to adjust your aperture, and potentially ISO, to maintain a correct exposure.

Assignment 2: Blur/Freeze motion
* [[Blur motion]]
	* Choose a moving subject and photograph it against a still background
	* Secure your camera on a tripod. This ensures the static background is in sharp focus to contrast with the motion blur.
	* Choose a shutter speed of 1/4 second or longer according to the available light and motion of the subject.
	* GOAL: Background remains still and the moving subject appears as a blur of motion.
	* What is the problem with these images?
		* Long shutter speed in daytime = too much light (over exposed)
		* Car lights much more visible at night
		* Poor Composition
* [[Freeze motion]]
	* We can suspend a subject mid-movement to show that it is moving in space.
	* Photograph a moving subject using a fast shutter speed to freeze everything in the image.
	* Make sure your subject is in an obvious state of motion
	* Design an image specifically. Do NOT use the same subject for the motion blur image.
	* Select 1/500 sec or faster.
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007223351.png)
	* I would suggest photographing your Freeze image outside during the day, if possible, why?
		* You need a fast shutter speed to Freeze motion (1/500 sec)
		* Faster shutter speeds let less light into the camera
		* If you make your picture at night or indoors your camera will need a slower shutter speed to get enough light = motion blur
		* Fast shutter will be under-exposed

* [[Zoom]]
	* “zoom effect”
	* It is best to use a stationary (not moving) subject.
	* Mount camera on tripod.
	* Focus the camera on your subject and then switch to manual focus
	* Shutter speed somewhere between 1”- 2” sec. Try with different shutter speeds!
	* During the exposure, zoom the lens from widest to narrowest focal length (18mm to 45mm).
	* For optimum results using a Tripod for this image is strongly recommended.
		* Tips:
			* Low light is better
			* One of the problems with using longer shutter speeds is that you let more light into your camera. In bright situations this may lead to overexposing your image.
			* It’s easier to get well exposed zoom effect shots either indoors or at night-time.
			* It is possible to do a zoom effect with post-production (But dont do it)
			* Smooth Zooming: to get nice smooth motion lines in your photo you’ll need to zoom the lens smoothly. Keep zooming for the whole of the exposure.
			* Getting a good zoom effect photo takes a lot of practice and experimentation and/or a bit of luck.
* [[Panning]]
	* We can move our camera along with a moving subject to show motion in the background.
	* Blur motion
		* Static background is clear with no blur. 
		* Subject is blurred.
	* PANNING
		* Static background appears in blurred. 
		* Subject is sharp and in focus.
		* Method
			* Set Shutter speed to 1/30 or 1/20 sec.
			* Zoom your lens to 45mm to create more obvious motion blur.  
			* The car should be frozen in frame with motion blur in background.
			* Pre focus on spot in road (optional) and set focus to Manual.
		* Use slower shutter speeds to increase background blur.

		* Tip
			* Cars are the least interesting subjects you can photograph
			* Only submit your in-class Panning shot for Assignment if it is really good.
			* Try other moving objects like:
				* bike, scooter, skateboard

1. BLUR MOTION - Background is in focus, moving subject is blurred.  
2. FREEZE MOTION - Background is in focus, moving subject is frozen.  
3. ZOOM – Attach your camera to a tripod and zoom the lens in or out  
while the shutter is open during a long exposure.  
4. PANNING - Move camera along with a moving subject to show motion in  
the background.
