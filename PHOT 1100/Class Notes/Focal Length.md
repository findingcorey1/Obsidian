## Photographic Explorations: Week 9 – Focal Length Notes

These notes are drawn directly from the course materials for _Photographic Explorations_ (Fall 2025, Jon Chater, Langara).

### I. Definitions

- **Focal Length (FL):** The distance in millimeters (mm) from the middle of a lens to the imaging sensor.
    - Focal length is determined by the actual size (physical length) of the lens.
- **Field of View (FOV):** The area that can be seen when you look through a camera lens.
- **Sensor:** The light-sensitive component in a digital camera that detects light and converts it into the information that makes up a digital photograph.
- **Maximum Aperture:** The lens’s widest opening.
    - It appears as a ratio (e.g., 1:3.5), where the maximum aperture is the last part of the ratio (f/3.5).

### II. Focal Length and Field of View (FOV)

Focal length affects the field of view.

|Focal Length Type|Example Range|Field of View|Typical Uses/Notes|Source|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Short Lens** (Wide Angle/Fisheye)|14mm to 35mm|**Wide**|Wider than Normal. Used for landscapes, interiors, large group photos, and confined situations. Exaggerates perspective.||
|**Normal**|50mm|Similar to the human eye view.|Used for snapshots and average situations. (46° angle of view).||
|**Long Lens** (Telephoto/Super Telephoto)|80mm to 600mm|**Narrow**|Narrower than Normal. Used for portraits, wildlife, and sports.||

**Specific Lens Examples:**

- Fisheye: 15–16 mm.
- Wide-angle lens: 24–35 mm.
- Telephoto lens: 300 mm (18° angle of view).
- Super Telephoto lens: 200–600mm (4°–8° angle of view).

### III. Lens Types

#### Zoom Lens

- Covers a range of focal lengths (e.g., 18-300mm).
- Multi-purpose; ideal when photographing a variety of subjects (e.g., landscapes and portraits).
- Saves time by reducing the number of times the photographer needs to change the lens.

#### Prime Lens (Fixed Focal-length Lens)

- Has only one focal length (cannot zoom).
- Tend to be **sharper** than zoom lenses due to a lower number of lens elements.
- Often significantly cheaper.
- Tend to have a larger maximum aperture (f/1.4 to f/2.8).

### IV. Effects of Focal Length (Magnification & Depth Compression)

Focal length affects the image in two ways: the field of view (amount of scene shown) and the size of objects (magnification and depth compression).

|Focal Length Characteristic|Effect on Image/Perspective|Resulting Appearance|Source|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Wide Angle** (Short FL, e.g., 20mm)|Exaggerates perspective. Background appears far away.|Makes objects appear further apart. Trees in the background appear smaller.||
|**Telephoto** (Long FL, e.g., 85mm)|Appears to flatten the image (depth compression). Background appears closer.|Makes objects appear closer together.||

- To maintain the same size of a foreground subject (like a tree or a person) across different focal lengths:
    - With a short (wide-angle) focal length, the camera must be placed **close** to the subject.
    - With a long (telephoto) focal length, the camera must be placed **far away** from the subject.

### V. Sensor Size and Crop Factor

- Different digital cameras utilize different sensor sizes.
- The width and height of the sensor determine the Field Of View and are used to calculate the Crop Factor.

#### Sensor Types

- **Full Frame Sensor (35mm / FX):**
    - Dimensions are 36 x 24mm (the same dimensions as a frame of 35mm film).
    - Crop factor = 1.
- **Cropped Sensor (APS-C / DX):**
    - A cropped sensor is exposed to a smaller area of the image projected by the lens.
    - It captures a smaller area of the scene at the center of the lens compared to a full-frame sensor.
    - The Canon R100 has a crop factor of 1.6, meaning its sensor is 1.6 times smaller than a full-frame sensor.

### VI. Week 9 Logistics

- **Today's Activities:** Assignment 6: Focal Length, and a Quiz on Focal length.
- **Next Week:** Bonus Assignment - Macro (Tues/Thurs).
- **Assignment 6 Due:** November 13, 11 pm (Instructions on Brightspace).
- **Quiz Password:** 50mm.
- **Assignment Constraints:** Photos must be horizontal (landscape) format, and the person should be shown full length (whole body) in all photos.
