Learning Outcome
* Use basic camera functions with proper care and handling
* Control exposure via shutter, ISO, and aperture with an understanding of equivalent exposure
* Lots of questions about exposure will feature in Mid-term and Final Exam

What is Exposure?
* Exposure is the overall brightness or darkness of a photograph
* The amount of light that reaches the camera sensor when a picture is being taken
	* More light = Brighter photo
	* Less light = Darker photo

[[Exposure Triangle]]
* ISO
	* Noise/image quality
* Aperture
	* Depth of field
* Shutter Speed
	* Blur or freeze motion

[[Aperture]] (Is like an eye)
* What happens to your pupil in the dark?
	* Expands (dialates)
* What happens to your pupil in bright light?
	* Shrinks (Contrict)
* Adjustable opening in the lends of your camera
* Controls the amount of light that reaches your image sensor during exposure
* Aperture measurements are referred to as f-stops
* The smaller hte f-stop number, the larger the lends opening
* The larger the f-stop number the smaller the lens opening
* f1.8 smallest, f/22 largest (in typical dslr)

[[School/PHOT 1100/Class Notes/Depth of Field]]
* The area of sharpness or focus (from near to far) within a photograph
* Depth of field can be influeced by three factors
	1. Aperture
	2. Distance between camera and subject
	3. Focal length

[[ISO]]
* Indicated your digital camera's sensitivity to light
* The higher the ISO number, the less light is needed to take a photo that is correctly exposed
* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007194433.png)
* General rule it's best to use the lowest ISO you possibly can
* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007194421.png)
* Higher ISO = more "noise or grain" in your picture

[[Shutter Speed]]:
* Like an eyelid opening and closing
* Shutter speed is a measurement of the time the shutter is open
* Measured in seconds or fractions of a second
* Typical shutter speeds on cameras range from the fast 1/4000 (one four thousandth of a second) to the very slow 30s
* 1/60 most important
	* capturing handheld photo w/o blur from camera shake and creating natural motion blur 
* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007194408.png)

* Water = Light (amount controlled by tap)
* ![[Pasted image 20251007194757.png]]
* Exposure is like filling a glass with water
	* Water = Light
	* Under exposed
		* Noit enought light to fill the glass
	* Correct Exposure
		* Exactly the right amount of light
	* Over Exposed
		* Too much light, the glass overflows
* A "[[Stop]]"
	* Doubling or halving of the amount of light let in when taking a photo
	* ![[Pasted image 20251007195028.png]]
* Photos using Fast shutter speed
	* To freeze motion, set a shutter speed at 1/500 sec or faster
* Photographs that use a SLow Shutter Speed
	* 1/15 or below
* [[Light meter]]
	* Tells you whether your image is correctly exposed, underexposed or over exposed before you take your shot, so you can adjust
	* ![[Pasted image 20251007195303.png]]
* [[Manual Mode]]
	* Why is it the best choice for learning exposure?
		* Advantages
			* (M) = Manual mode: Allows you full control over aperature and shutter speed
			* Makes you think, instead of camera thinking for you
			* Gives you skills to correct errors common in automatic mode
			* Teaches you the most important photographic skills: Exposure

Camera Basic Functions
* Diopter control
	* Allows to change viewfinder focus based on your eyesight
	* Slider is on the underside of viewfinder
	* ![[Pasted image 20251007195709.png]]
* Auto Focus
	* Want on most of the time
		* Times you want off, motion shots
	* In dark room when camera hunts for focus
		* Switch to manual mode instead
* Image Quality
	* JPEG
* Camera Mode
	* M = Manual - you choose the shutter speed, aperture and ISO.  
	* Av = Aperture Priority - you choose the aperture, camera chooses the shutter speed.  
	* Tv = Shutter Priority - you choose the shutter speed, camera chooses the aperture.  
	* P = Program - the camera becomes “point & shoot” and makes all decisions.
	* ![[Pasted image 20251007195914.png]]
* Shutter Speed
	* Set to manual
	* Fastest - 1/4000
	* Slowest - BULB (Holds and wont close until you let go)
* Aperture
	* Largest Aperture - 
	  F22 (Focal Length 18)
	  F32 (Focal Length 45)
	* Smallest Aperture - 
	  F4.5 (Focal Length 18)
	  F6.3 (Focal Length 45)
* Setting ISO
	* Lowest - 100
	* Highest - 12800
