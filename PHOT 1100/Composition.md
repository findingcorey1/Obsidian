Learning Outcome
* Produce photographs demonstrating elements of composition and design

What does composition mean? (In art)
* "Putting Together" and applies to any form of art... painting, writing, music, photography
* How the various elements in a photograph relate to each other and fit within the frame

Why learn all these rules?
* You ahve to learn the rules first before you know how to break them
* It is hard to recognize why something is creative without understanding the rules that it breaks

Good Compositions
* Arranges elements in a way that is pleasing to the eye and creates visual interest
* Helps lead the viewers eyes through the image
* Helps to make sure the viewer knows exactly what the photograph is about.

Principles of good compositions
* Subject and background
	* Every photograph should have a clear subject
	* Every subject may be one single thing, or single person, or it may be crown, but there should be a clear subject
	* Background is important, but it should not compete with your subject
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007220438.png)
* Simplicity
	* Include what's necessary within the image
	* Pay attention to what is around or behind your subject
	* Fire hydrant or garbage cans in the background? Do they contribute or distract from the purpose of the image?
	* If they don't add anything, you can either physically remove themm re-compose your frame, or choose a new location to shoot in
	* If they do not add anything, you can either physically remove them, re-composeyour frame, or choose a new location to shoot in.
	* Ex. Bad Composition
		* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007220709.png)
		* The viewer’s eye will wander and not be sure where to focus.
		* What is the subject of the photo? Unclear.
		* Is it a portrait?
		* The people walking down the path in the background are distracting. Equal size to him.

Eight Methods of Compositions
* Centered, Rule fo thirds, leading lines, Point of view (Low/high/close), framing, symmetry, patter/repetition, Foreground/Middle ground/Background
1. Centered
	* Main subject is in middle of image frame
	* Beginner photographer will do this shot
	* Some consider bad comp technique
	* Can be very powerful
	* ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007221058.png)
2. Rule of Thirds
	*  When you compose your picture, mentally divide the photo into thirds, horizontally & vertically so that you have nine equal parts.
	* With the grid in mind, identify the important points of interest and frame the photo so that the main subject is placed on one of the dividing lines.

3. Leading Lines
	* eye is naturally drawn along lines.
	* By using lines in your composition, you can affect the way we view the image.
	* Lines can pull the eye into a picture, towards the subject, or on a journey "through" the scene.
	* There are many different types of line – horizontal, vertical, diagonal, curvy, zigzag, circular etc
	* Architecture provides strong structural lines.
	* Landscapes provide softer, more natural lines.

4. Point of View (Low/High/Close)
	1. A lot of beginners shoot everything at head height... which can lead to very predictable compositions.
	2. Point of view is an aspect of composition that can add real drama to your subject.
	3. Some different points of view composition include:
		1. Birds Eye View (camera up high)
		   ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007221434.png)
		2. Worm Eye View (camera low down)
		   ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007221448.png)
		3. Close-Up (camera close to subject)
		   ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007221500.png)
5. Framing
	1. An image where the subject is framed by something.
	2. You can use architectural elements like windows and archways...
	   ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007221531.png)
6. Symmetry
	1. SYMMETRY refers to a line (either horizontal or vertical) that splits the photo in half and, if both sides of the photo are an exact mirror image of each other, then this photo is said to be symmetrical.
	2. ![](Pasted%20image%2020251007221616.png)
7. Pattern/Repetition
	1. Emphasize pattern:
		1. Fill your frame with any repeated occurrence of objects or shapes.
	2. Break pattern:
		1. Include a contrasting color, shape or texture that breaks the pattern, or a totally different object among a group of identical  
objects.
8. Foreground/Middle ground/ Background
	1. Foreground is what is closest to the camera.
	2. Background is the part of the image that is furthest away from the camera.
	3. Middle ground is part of the image in between the foreground and the background.

Metadata
* Information embedded within digital photos, includes:
	* Date of photo
	* camera model
	* camera/ smartphone serial number
	* Aperture, Shutter speed, iso
	*   If your image does not carry this information, you may be asked to show me the original file on your camera
