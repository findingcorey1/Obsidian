**Lecture Notes**

The study of **biomedical ethics** requires careful analysis of complex issues and clear thinking about difficult problems in healthcare. If our efforts in this regard are to be successful, we will need some intellectual “tools” to work with. This introduction is designed to provide you with those tools.

In the first week of this course, you should read Chapter 1 of your textbook (_Biomedical Ethics in Canada_, Fisher et al.).  For this first 'lecture' I will outline a brief introduction to philosophical reasoning and arguments and touch on some points up to section 1.3 of Chapter 1 (although you should aim to read the whole chapter).

Some students will have taken philosophy courses in the past and may already be familiar with these tools and concepts. For others, this will be the first exposure to the ways philosophers approach problems in general, and ethical problems in healthcare in particular.  We will complete Chapter 1 next week.

**Philosophical Reasoning**

In ordinary conversation, we sometimes use the word “argument” to mean the same thing as a disagreement or debate. But in philosophy, an argument is something more specific: it is a set of claims offered in support of a conclusion. Arguments are attempts to convince someone that a claim or action is reasonable or justified.

An argument must contain at least two components:

1. A **conclusion** – the position being advocated

2. One or more **premises** – reasons offered in support of the conclusion

**Example 1 (non-ethical, familiar):**

P1: All humans are mortal.

P2: Florence Nightingale was a human.

C: Florence Nightingale was mortal

**Example 2 (biomedical context):**

P1: Administering antibiotics unnecessarily contributes to antibiotic resistance.

P2: Physicians and nurses should avoid practices that cause unnecessary harm.

C: Physicians and nurses should not prescribe or administer antibiotics when they are not medically required.

Notice how the second example is an ethical argument — the conclusion is not just a statement of fact but a recommendation about what healthcare providers ought to do.

**Ethical Reasoning**

Ethical reasoning applies the same logical standards as reasoning in science or medicine, but to questions about right and wrong, duties, rights, and responsibilities.

For example, in biomedical contexts, questions might include:

- - Should a terminally ill patient have the right to assisted dying?
    - Is it ethical to allocate scarce ICU beds based on age or likelihood of recovery?
    - What obligations do healthcare providers have when treating patients who refuse medical advice?

Unlike scientific questions, these issues cannot be resolved by empirical data alone. Instead, they require consistent, well-structured reasoning supported by ethical principles**.**

**Example 3 (ethical reasoning in healthcare):**

P1: Patients have a right to make informed decisions about their own healthcare.

P2: Performing a medical procedure without consent violates that right.

C: Therefore, performing a medical procedure without consent is unethical.

Here, each premise supports the conclusion, and the reasoning is clear and structured.

**Why this Matters**

Both nurses and philosophers bring important perspectives to biomedical ethics.

- For **nursing students**, these reasoning skills will help you justify clinical decisions, communicate effectively with patients and families, and participate in policy discussions.
- For **philosophy students**, these tools will help you analyze real-world ethical problems in healthcare and apply abstract theories to concrete cases

In this course, whenever you make a claim (e.g., “patients should have the right to refuse treatment”), you should be able to say: “Here is my thesis, and here are my reasons for holding it.” And you should be ready to respond if others challenge your reasoning.  This is the essence of philosophical — and ethical — dialogue.

### **Moral Relativism**

As you read in Chapter 1, some people find the idea of a moral **theory** difficult to understand. A theory is supposed to be something that applies to everyone. But doesn't each of us have different ideas of wrong and right? Questions like this often lead people to a position called "moral relativism." Moral relativism is the doctrine that moral truth or value is relative to the beliefs of some individual or group. Effectively, the view is that something is right for me but not be for you and we can just agree to disagree.  That's a nice sentiment but not very defensible.  If I think stealing your wallet is ok because I need the money, and you disagree with me, surely we want to say more than let's agree to disagree.  This seems to miss the point about ethics and ethical actions.

Relativism comes in two types. The most common sort is cultural relativism, which is the doctrine that morality is relative to the beliefs or practices of particular cultural groups. The second, more extreme form of relativism is known as "subjectivism." Subjectivism is the doctrine that morality is relative to the beliefs of the individual.

While an extended examination of moral relativism is beyond the scope of this course, the frequency with which some version or another of this doctrine pops up suggests that it warrants at least a brief mention. First, let us deal very briefly with subjectivism. Very few people, if any, actually believe that right and wrong is relative to the individual. In fact, our everyday moral practices imply that we do all believe in at least some shared values. For example, it is only because we have shared moral beliefs that we bother **blaming** people when we think they've done something wrong. We only blame people for their actions when we think those actions have failed to live up to some shared standard. What about cultural relativism? A thorough examination of the merits of cultural relativism is, again, beyond the scope of this course.

For our purposes, it will be sufficient to point out two things. First, there does seem to be a remarkable degree of agreement, even among members of very different cultures, as to the basic principles of morality. All cultures put restrictions on lying. All cultures see justice as a good thing. Different peoples may differ in how they _apply_ those principles, or in the relative weight assigned to them, but they honour them none the less suggesting that they are not, in fact, relative at all.

Second, from the point of view of moral philosophy, the fact that "my culture believes doing X is morally wrong" is never sufficient reason to believe that doing X is wrong. As philosophers, we always want to ask questions like, "Why do we think doing X wrong?" "How do we know that doing X is wrong?" "What would happen if we all decided that doing X is right instead?"

Chapter 1 attempts to establish the general requirements for moral judgments.  A moral judgment ought to be logical, and based on both facts and acceptable moral principles.  In other words we must be able to justify our judgments by appealing to something other than our own personal opinions, beliefs, preferences and so on. This is what distinguishes moral claims or judgments from those informed by etiquette, law, religion, self-interest, personal opinion, and codes of ethics.  We need a substantive account of what makes an action moral or immoral in order to develop a convincing moral claim, especially when the stakes are so high as they often are in healthcare.  This is why we appeal to one of the normative theories of ethics, which we will spend more time on in Week 2.
