Lukas faces a profound ethical dilemma centered on a direct conflict between his duty of confidentiality to James and his duty of beneficence and respect for autonomy toward Emily. By honoring James's request for secrecy, Dr. Lukas becomes morally complicit in a deception that violates Emily's right to make a fully informed decision about her own body and pregnancy, a right she has already explicitly framed according to her values. This withholding of critical genetic information—which is inherently familial, not purely individual—forces Emily to assume significant physical and profound psychological risks against her will, fundamentally betraying the physician's primary fiduciary duty to his pregnant patient and prioritizing one partner's moral beliefs over the other's bodily autonomy and well-being.

Right now Dr. Lucas is currently facing the dilemma of confidentiality of James requesting not to disclosing the results to Emily as due to beneficence and respect for autonomy towards Emily. If we honor James request for secrecy, then it would cause more complications in terms of violating Emily's rights to make a fully informed decision on her own pregnancy and body. But at the same time, Dr. Lucas would directly breach the doctor patient relationship in terms of confidentiality between the two. It was also the rights she had expressed about with James that she did not want a chance to carry a fetus with severe, life limiting conditions. At the same time if Dr. Lucas does disclose to Emily about the information, it not only violates his rights as a doctor because he would be breaking the rules as withholding information from Emily in terms of "inform concent" and the duty of "maleficence".
