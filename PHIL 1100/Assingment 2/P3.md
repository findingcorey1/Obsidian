V. Practical and Ethical Resolution

A morally responsible resolution should aim to minimize harm to all parties while upholding core ethical principles. Dr. Lukas should first engage in further dialogue with James, explaining the moral and professional obligations involved. He should stress that Emily’s right to know derives from her role as a directly affected patient, and that non-disclosure could cause greater harm in the long term. Dr. Lukas should encourage joint disclosure, offering counseling to help the couple discuss the implications together. If James still refuses, Dr. Lukas would be ethically justified—indeed, morally obligated—to disclose the information directly to Emily.
