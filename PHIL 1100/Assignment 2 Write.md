- Emily is 8 weeks pregnant
- James carries a mutation with high likelihood that any fetus inheriting it would have a condition that is incompatible with survival
	- Holds personal moral objecting to abortion
	- Concerned that if is emily is aware of the risks, she might choose to terminate the pregnancy 
		- Previously expressed that she would not want to take the chance of carrying the fetus with a severe, life-limiting conditions
	- James request the physician to not disclose the test result to emily, stating that disclosure would conflict with his deeply held belief and cause him significant distress

Introduction:
With the case of Emily, James, and Dr. Lukas, there are many complications that arise between the confidentiality and autonomy of the doctor and the patients. After James learned about the complications that arise from the genetic mutations that he carries, he has the rights of confidentiality as a patient to not let his partner, Emily, know about the condition that would most likely lead to her to choosing an abortion, which it she had expressed before to her partner. Now Dr. Lucas is caught between either informing Emily about the information, which also would breach the confidentiality of the rights as a doctor. At the same time Dr. Lucas would have the rights to inform Emily about the information, In not telling her would violate her own autonomy and potentially causing significant harm later in the pregnancy. After comparing about the pros and cons of the situation, I would argue that Dr. Lucas should disclose Jame’s genetic test results to Emily because not doing so would violate her autonomy, preventing informed consent, and exposing her to inevitable harm. Which in this case in informing Emily about the harm outweighs Jame’s confidentiality requests.

[[Paragraph 1]] Explain the harm if Dr. Lucas does not disclose the information (Same as P2)
* Dr. Lucas’s confidentiality as a doctor
* Duty to warn and inform

Right now Dr. Lucas is currently facing the dilemma of confidentiality of James requesting not to disclosing the results to Emily as due to beneficence and respect for autonomy towards Emily. If we honor James request for secrecy, then it would cause more complications in terms of violating Emily's rights to make a fully informed decision on her own pregnancy and body. But at the same time, Dr. Lucas would directly breach the doctor patient relationship in terms of confidentiality between the two. It was also the rights she had expressed about with James that she did not want a chance to carry a fetus with severe, life limiting conditions. At the same time if Dr. Lucas does disclose to Emily about the information, it not only violates his rights as a doctor because he would be breaking the rules as withholding information from Emily in terms of "inform concent" and the duty of "maleficence". 

P2: Ethical Principle (Autonomy, beneficence, nonmalificients, justice) or talk about the benefits if she did compared to did not 

The ethical principles for Dr. Lucas centers around the principle of Autonomy for James (his rights to confidentiality and moral beliefs) versus the principles of beneficence (doing good for Emily) and non-maleficence (avoiding harm to Emily). If Dr. Lucas does decide to keep the information to himself, then he in turn would respect James's autonomy but at the same time violate Emily's, as she cannot make any decision on keeping the pregnancy or not. This choice also leads to maleficence, as it would force Emily to have to withhold the grudge to endure the physical and psychological harm from the pregnancy mishap that's were agaist her own wishes. If anything if Dr. Lukas informs Emily about the information, he would in turn breach James confidentiality but in turn enforces Emily's autonomy, which allows her to make her own values and her choices on terminating the pregnancy or not. Another benefit to disclosing the report to Emily is that it justifys Emily's own well being and self determination. Of all this I would argue that the significance of informing Emily about the complications outweighs James autonomy even though it it breaches James confidentiality.  

P3: Talk about abortion and all the problems attached

V. Practical and Ethical Resolution

A morally responsible resolution should aim to minimize harm to all parties while upholding core ethical principles. Dr. Lukas should first engage in further dialogue with James, explaining the moral and professional obligations involved. He should stress that Emily’s right to know derives from her role as a directly affected patient, and that non-disclosure could cause greater harm in the long term. Dr. Lukas should encourage joint disclosure, offering counseling to help the couple discuss the implications together. If James still refuses, Dr. Lukas would be ethically justified—indeed, morally obligated—to disclose the information directly to Emily.
