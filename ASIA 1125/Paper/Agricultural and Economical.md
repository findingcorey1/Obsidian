During the time of the Qing Dynasty in 1644 - 1911, China's Agricultural and Economic status flourished through various agricultural innovations expanding the global economy and trade networks. Those developments introduced many outstanding levels of excess agricultural products which in turn enabled the state and local economy to expand its local production to both the domestic consumption and export it to neighboring regions and to other places like Europe. After the people have realized the economic potential on the export of goods, the Qing government had established the Canton system, a framework concentrating for foreign trades at the port of Canton. The system would allow China to take part in global commerce while maintaining strict political control over foreign merchants who decides to make deals with them. The development of the Canton System lead to and shaped China’s agricultural strength by having improvements in farming techniques, introduction of new crops, and the massive increase in population which created an influx of wealth and stability which made the controlled foreign trade both possible and profitable.

During the Qing dynasty, Agricultural productivity increased dramatically in 17th-century China due to both new crops and improved techniques. One of the significant factors were the introduction of new crops, most notable being the Maize Corn and Sweet Potatoes and also traditional stables like rice and wheat. (Land MDPI)
