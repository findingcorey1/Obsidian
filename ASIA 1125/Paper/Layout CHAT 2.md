- Increased caloric output and diet diversification.
    

### **B. Improved Farming Techniques**

- Widespread use of crop rotation and irrigation improvements.
    
- Local technological innovations such as better plows and seed selection.

# **III. Agricultural Surplus as the Basis for Domestic Market Growth**

### **A. Greater Internal Trade Networks**

- Surplus goods circulated through regional markets.
    
- Development of merchant networks in Jiangnan, Fujian, Guangdong.
    

### **B. Commodities for Export**

# **V. How Agricultural Strength Enabled the Canton System**

### **A. Agricultural Product Surpluses Were the Basis of Export Wealth**

### **B. Surplus Wealth Funded Local and State Administration**

- Allowed the state to maintain customs offices, port supervision, and naval patrols.
    

### **C. Domestic Agricultural Stability Made Restrictive Trade Policies Possible**

- Because the internal economy remained self-sufficient, China could afford strict controls without risking economic collapse.

# **VI. Effects of the Canton System on the Domestic Economy**

### **A. Increased Demand for Export Goods Stimulated Rural Production**

- Example: tea-growing regions expanded; silk production revived in Jiangnan.
    

### **B. Merchant Wealth Circulated Back Into Rural Markets**

- Merchant families invested in land, transport, storage, and labor.
    

### **C. Reinforced China’s Position in Global Trade**

- Became a key exporter of luxury and daily goods.
    
- Massive inflows of silver strengthened the monetary system.
    

---

# **VII. Conclusion**

- Restate key argument: agricultural expansion → surplus wealth → emergence of Canton System.
    
- Emphasize how the economy remained rooted in agriculture but increasingly tied to global markets.
    
- Closing insight: The strength of China’s agrarian foundations shaped not just its 17th-century prosperity but also its early encounters with global capitalism.
