Thesis: 
Between 1700 and 1800, Qing China experienced remarkable economic growth driven by agricultural expansion and internal commerce, yet its restrictive trade policies—most notably the Canton System—revealed a tension between self-sufficiency and emerging global economic integration

- Qing Dynasty 1644-1911
- Founded by northeast asian people known as "Manchus", (Manchus from MAnchuria, NE of the great wall)
- The Manchus were originally Jurchen tribes, a people who are recorded as early as the 10th century living northeast of what was then China, blockaded by the Great Wall
The Kang-Qian Flourishing Age
The Qing "Golden Era" was made up of the reigns of three emperors:
- [Emperor Kangxi](https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/china-history/emperor-kangxi.htm) (reign 1661–1722): The Qing Golden Age began.
- Emperor Yongzheng (reign 1723–1735): The Golden Age continued.
- Emperor Qianlong (ruled 1735–1796): The Golden Age reached its peak
- The Kang-Qian Flourishing Age lasted 135 years. It was the last golden age of China's feudal dynasties.
- The Qing Dynasty annexed Mongolia, Northeast China, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, establishing a territory larger than that of today's China — the largest China has ever been.
- At that time, China accounted for 32 percent of the world's industrial output. Per capita grain output reached 622 kg per person in 1700,
- China's population surpassed 100 million for the first time in its history and grew to 300 million, which laid the foundation for China to become the most populous country.

### Agricultural?

- Looks at how population pressure in Qing China affected land use, the commercial economy, and agricultural “involution.”
- grain price data from southern China (1776–1910) to trace how surplus labor moved into non-agricultural sectors as land became saturated
- **Malthusian Pressure:** The Qing Dynasty experienced an **unprecedented population boom** that created immense **"Malthusian" population pressure** due to limited arable land and stagnant technological advancement (1)
	- The population explosion led to the **lowest historical per capita arable land** in the mid- to late Qing dynasty (1)
- **Agricultural Saturation and "Involution":** The growth in population resulted in the **over-concentration of agricultural labor** and the **saturation of the farming population**
	- Farmers engaged in more **intensive farming practices** on limited land, but this led to the "involution" of agriculture, characterized by **diminishing marginal returns on labor** and low productivity (1)
- **Inability to Sustain Population:** The **carrying capacity of arable land** and traditional agricultural production **could not sustain the surplus population**
	- . The worsening population–land ratio meant the land reached a point where it **could not absorb more labor**
- The surplus population, unable to be supported by agriculture, was **forced to transition to non-agricultural industries** in search of livelihoods

- **Explosive Growth Rate:** Between **1700 and 1850**, the population of Southwest China (Yunnan, Guizhou, and parts of Sichuan Province) quadrupled, expanding from 5 million to approximately 20 million people
- **Decisive Recovery:** The Southwest began to recover from the devastations of the Ming-Qing transition after 1681. By **1700**, the population had already recovered its sixteenth-century level of 4 to 5 million.
- The central argument regarding the 1700–1850 period is that **food production alone cannot explain the rapid population rise**. Instead, the growth was primarily a response to commercial and industrial expan
- **Scale of Immigration:** The immigrant population grew significantly, increasing from only a few percent in **1700** to roughly 10 percent within fifty years, and reaching almost **20 percent** (3 to 4 million people) of the 20 million total population by the mid-nineteenth century
- **Industrial Magnet:** Unlike earlier Ming migrations driven by government policy, immigration after 1700 was a response to the **rising demand for labor** created by the **expansion of the southwestern mining industry**. Increased economic opportunity pulled large numbers of immigrants to the Southwest.

### Silver/Domestic Trade/Market Integration

### Canton System/Foreign Trade 
https://doi.org/10.3390/land13081183
- **Commerce and Trade:** The surplus population was pushed into **commerce** 
	- This shift involved activities aimed at **exchange and profit**
- **Handicrafts and Processing:** Labor shifted into the **handicrafts** industry
	- This included the cultivation and preliminary **processing of cash crops** in family workshops, such as tea production, sugar making, and fruit processing
	- In regions like the Jiangnan area, **handicrafts evolved from household sidelines to the main means of livelihood** for farming households
- **Commercial Prosperity:** During the Qing Dynasty, the **commercial economy was exceptionally active**, featuring flourishing long-distance trade and the expansion of domestic markets (6)
- **Southern Focus:** The study specifically examines 12 southern provinces, including **Guangdong** (where Canton/Guangzhou is located)
	- The southern region was noted as the economic heart of the nation with bustling trade (9)

- **Policy Scope:** The system was a foreign trade policy established by the Qing dynasty designed to regulate and restrict foreign trade
- **Restriction:** Under this policy, trade with foreign merchants was restricted solely to the southern port city of Guangzhou, which was known to outsiders as **Canton**
- **Qing Motivation:**
   - The system emerged in response to growing Western interest in Chinese goods.
   - The Qing dynasty sought to maintain control over foreign influences and activities of foreign merchants.
   - By the 1750s, Qing officials were worried about the rising number of foreigners entering the country and the potential influence on Chinese culture.
- **Canton Emergence:** Over time, Canton emerged as the most favorable trade location for foreign merchants and became China's leading trade port
- **Formal Restriction (1757):** While the restriction was unofficial previously, the Qing formally announced in **1757** that Canton was the only Chinese port open to foreign traders, officially enacting the Canton System.
- **Government Oversight**: Qing officials were sent to port cities to oversee trade business, as maritime trade was deemed lucrative and politically delicate

<u>Conflicting Counsels to confuse the Age (Book)</u>
* **Population and Vulnerability:** Guangzhou had a **"particularly great numbers of poor people needing to be fed"**. The poor, such as artisan laborers, often worked for "few coppers" and were frequently unable to afford food when prices soared.
* **Grain Source:** The markets of Guangzhou relied on grain imported from the adjacent Guangxi Province.
* **Price Manipulation:** The price of rice was subject to **"speculation by hoarders"** and price manipulation by retailers. Shopkeepers acted with **"solidarity within the trade"** (_qihang_), often spreading false rumors about weather (like wind signaling drought or two days of rain portending flood) to push prices up multiple times in a single day
* **Supplementary Reserves:** Emida secured imperial assent to set up a **large supplementary grain reserve** for stabilizing sales in Guangzhou. This reserve was intended to protect the city's population from price manipulations by merchants who controlled the grain supply.
* **Set Price:** A set price of **"one tael per bushel"** by granary measure was established as an "everlasting rule" [98, 105n].

Cohong: https://www.britannica.com/money/cohong
- The cohong was essentially a **guild of Chinese merchants**. It is also known by the names **cong-hong, gonghang, hong, or kung-hang**
- The central government **authorized the cohong to trade with Western merchants** specifically at **Guangzhou (Canton)**
- When Guangzhou became the **only Chinese port open to foreign trade in 1757**, the hong merchants were the **only merchants in the city permitted to sell commodities like tea and silk to Westerners**
- Theoretically, the number of merchants was **13**, although they frequently numbered **no more than 4**
- A critical function was established in the **1740s**. A system required that every foreign ship arriving at Guangzhou had to be **supervised by a hong merchant**.
- This designated hong merchant served as a guarantor to the Chinese government, ensuring both the **payment of all duties** and the **proper behaviour of the foreign traders**.
- Despite being subject to **heavy exactions from officials**, some hong merchants were able to accumulate **great wealth**
