Thesis: 
Between 1700 and 1800, Qing China experienced remarkable economic growth driven by agricultural expansion and internal commerce, yet its restrictive trade policies—most notably the Canton System—revealed a tension between self-sufficiency and emerging global economic integration

- Qing Dynasty 1644-1911
- Founded by northeast asian people known as "Manchus", (Manchus from MAnchuria, NE of the great wall)
- The Manchus were originally Jurchen tribes, a people who are recorded as early as the 10th century living northeast of what was then China, blockaded by the Great Wall
The Kang-Qian Flourishing Age
The Qing "Golden Era" was made up of the reigns of three emperors:
- [Emperor Kangxi](https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/china-history/emperor-kangxi.htm) (reign 1661–1722): The Qing Golden Age began.
- Emperor Yongzheng (reign 1723–1735): The Golden Age continued.
- Emperor Qianlong (ruled 1735–1796): The Golden Age reached its peak
- The Kang-Qian Flourishing Age lasted 135 years. It was the last golden age of China's feudal dynasties.
- The Qing Dynasty annexed Mongolia, Northeast China, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, establishing a territory larger than that of today's China — the largest China has ever been.
- At that time, China accounted for 32 percent of the world's industrial output. Per capita grain output reached 622 kg per person in 1700,
- China's population surpassed 100 million for the first time in its history and grew to 300 million, which laid the foundation for China to become the most populous country.
