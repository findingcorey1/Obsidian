Thesis: 
Between 1700 and 1800, Qing China experienced remarkable economic growth driven by agricultural expansion and internal commerce, yet its restrictive trade policies—most notably the Canton System—revealed a tension between self-sufficiency and emerging global economic integration
or 
(Agri + Trade)
“During the 17th century, China’s expanding agricultural productivity—driven by new crops, improved farming techniques, and population growth—created the surplus wealth that enabled the Qing state to develop the Canton System as a controlled gateway for foreign trade, linking domestic agrarian strength with carefully managed global commercial exchange.”

- Qing Dynasty 1644-1911
- Founded by northeast asian people known as "Manchus", (Manchus from MAnchuria, NE of the great wall)
- The Manchus were originally Jurchen tribes, a people who are recorded as early as the 10th century living northeast of what was then China, blockaded by the Great Wall
The Kang-Qian Flourishing Age
The Qing "Golden Era" was made up of the reigns of three emperors:
- [Emperor Kangxi](https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/china-history/emperor-kangxi.htm) (reign 1661–1722): The Qing Golden Age began.
- Emperor Yongzheng (reign 1723–1735): The Golden Age continued.
- Emperor Qianlong (ruled 1735–1796): The Golden Age reached its peak
- The Kang-Qian Flourishing Age lasted 135 years. It was the last golden age of China's feudal dynasties.
- The Qing Dynasty annexed Mongolia, Northeast China, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, establishing a territory larger than that of today's China — the largest China has ever been.
- At that time, China accounted for 32 percent of the world's industrial output. Per capita grain output reached 622 kg per person in 1700,
- China's population surpassed 100 million for the first time in its history and grew to 300 million, which laid the foundation for China to become the most populous country.

### Agricultural?
https://doi.org/10.3390/land13081183 
- Looks at how population pressure in Qing China affected land use, the commercial economy, and agricultural “involution.”
- grain price data from southern China (1776–1910) to trace how surplus labor moved into non-agricultural sectors as land became saturated
- **Malthusian Pressure:** The Qing Dynasty experienced an **unprecedented population boom** that created immense **"Malthusian" population pressure** due to limited arable land and stagnant technological advancement (1)
	- The population explosion led to the **lowest historical per capita arable land** in the mid- to late Qing dynasty (1)
- **Agricultural Saturation and "Involution":** The growth in population resulted in the **over-concentration of agricultural labor** and the **saturation of the farming population**
	- Farmers engaged in more **intensive farming practices** on limited land, but this led to the "involution" of agriculture, characterized by **diminishing marginal returns on labor** and low productivity (1)
- **Inability to Sustain Population:** The **carrying capacity of arable land** and traditional agricultural production **could not sustain the surplus population**
	- . The worsening population–land ratio meant the land reached a point where it **could not absorb more labor**
- The surplus population, unable to be supported by agriculture, was **forced to transition to non-agricultural industries** in search of livelihoods
- **Maize (Corn) and Sweet Potatoes:** These crops were introduced to China starting in the mid-Ming dynasty. However, their widespread adoption and impact on grain production grew later, and sometimes they were classified as a "curiosity" or "fruit" in 17th and 18th-century local histories.

- **Explosive Growth Rate:** Between **1700 and 1850**, the population of Southwest China (Yunnan, Guizhou, and parts of Sichuan Province) quadrupled, expanding from 5 million to approximately 20 million people
- **Decisive Recovery:** The Southwest began to recover from the devastations of the Ming-Qing transition after 1681. By **1700**, the population had already recovered its sixteenth-century level of 4 to 5 million.
- The central argument regarding the 1700–1850 period is that **food production alone cannot explain the rapid population rise**. Instead, the growth was primarily a response to commercial and industrial expan
- **Scale of Immigration:** The immigrant population grew significantly, increasing from only a few percent in **1700** to roughly 10 percent within fifty years, and reaching almost **20 percent** (3 to 4 million people) of the 20 million total population by the mid-nineteenth century
- **Industrial Magnet:** Unlike earlier Ming migrations driven by government policy, immigration after 1700 was a response to the **rising demand for labor** created by the **expansion of the southwestern mining industry**. Increased economic opportunity pulled large numbers of immigrants to the Southwest.
Farming
- **Crop Switching and Rotation:** From 1700 onward in the Southwest, farmers began adopting **early ripening rice** and moving to **double and even triple cropping** to increase food base efficiency.

Types of crops
- **Liquor/Alcoholic Spirits:** The creation and consumption of alcohol were widespread and frequently regulated by the state
- **Yellow Liquor:** This was a higher-quality product that required fine food grains, such as wheat, glutinous rice, or glutinous millet/setaria.
- **Meat and Fish:** These items were purchased for feasting and hospitality.
- **Spices and Flavorings:** **Cinnamon and pepper** were listed among the requirements for feasts.
- Rice/Wheat/Millet
- **Cotton:** Used for raw cotton and cloth.
- **Silk and Raw Silk:** These were prominent commodities, particularly in the Jiangnan region.
- **Fruit:** Includes common fruits such as **dates, persimmons, and grapes**, all of which could be used for distillation.
- **Medicaments:** Mentioned among crops under cultivation.
- **Tobacco:** Cultivation was a concern for officials, who sometimes sought to prohibit the diversion of good crop land to this crop.
Farming Techniques
- 1. Water Management and Land Reclamation
	- The maintenance and restoration of hydraulic systems were crucial for agriculture, often requiring significant official intervention:
	- **River System Management:** Officials, such as county magistrates, undertook dedicated efforts to restore **complex river systems** to make the local countryside safe for agriculture. This included **guiding** rivers, streams, creeks, and channels to control their flow, sometimes dividing or gathering them.
- 2. Intensive Cultivation and Labor Input
	- • **Intensive Farming:** Population pressure drove farmers to engage in **intensive farming practices** and increased **labor inputs** to boost per-unit area yields and sustain livelihoods on limited land
	- **Plowing and Tilling:** General agricultural diligence included **ploughing**. It was noted that good farming required iron implements with which to plough.

### Canton System/Foreign Trade 
https://doi.org/10.3390/land13081183
- **Commerce and Trade:** The surplus population was pushed into **commerce** 
	- This shift involved activities aimed at **exchange and profit**
- **Handicrafts and Processing:** Labor shifted into the **handicrafts** industry
	- This included the cultivation and preliminary **processing of cash crops** in family workshops, such as tea production, sugar making, and fruit processing
	- In regions like the Jiangnan area, **handicrafts evolved from household sidelines to the main means of livelihood** for farming households
- **Commercial Prosperity:** During the Qing Dynasty, the **commercial economy was exceptionally active**, featuring flourishing long-distance trade and the expansion of domestic markets (6)
- **Southern Focus:** The study specifically examines 12 southern provinces, including **Guangdong** (where Canton/Guangzhou is located)
	- The southern region was noted as the economic heart of the nation with bustling trade (9)

https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/canton-system-1757-1842#research-starter-title
- **Policy Scope:** The system was a foreign trade policy established by the Qing dynasty designed to regulate and restrict foreign trade
- **Restriction:** Under this policy, trade with foreign merchants was restricted solely to the southern port city of Guangzhou, which was known to outsiders as **Canton**
- **Qing Motivation:**
   - The system emerged in response to growing Western interest in Chinese goods.
   - The Qing dynasty sought to maintain control over foreign influences and activities of foreign merchants.
   - By the 1750s, Qing officials were worried about the rising number of foreigners entering the country and the potential influence on Chinese culture.
- **Canton Emergence:** Over time, Canton emerged as the most favorable trade location for foreign merchants and became China's leading trade port
- **Formal Restriction (1757):** While the restriction was unofficial previously, the Qing formally announced in **1757** that Canton was the only Chinese port open to foreign traders, officially enacting the Canton System.
- **Government Oversight**: Qing officials were sent to port cities to oversee trade business, as maritime trade was deemed lucrative and politically delicate

<u>Conflicting Counsels to confuse the Age (Book)</u>
* **Population and Vulnerability:** Guangzhou had a **"particularly great numbers of poor people needing to be fed"**. The poor, such as artisan laborers, often worked for "few coppers" and were frequently unable to afford food when prices soared.
* **Grain Source:** The markets of Guangzhou relied on grain imported from the adjacent Guangxi Province.
* **Price Manipulation:** The price of rice was subject to **"speculation by hoarders"** and price manipulation by retailers. Shopkeepers acted with **"solidarity within the trade"** (_qihang_), often spreading false rumors about weather (like wind signaling drought or two days of rain portending flood) to push prices up multiple times in a single day
* **Supplementary Reserves:** Emida secured imperial assent to set up a **large supplementary grain reserve** for stabilizing sales in Guangzhou. This reserve was intended to protect the city's population from price manipulations by merchants who controlled the grain supply.
* **Set Price:** A set price of **"one tael per bushel"** by granary measure was established as an "everlasting rule" [98, 105n].

Cohong: https://www.britannica.com/money/cohong
- The cohong was essentially a **guild of Chinese merchants**. It is also known by the names **cong-hong, gonghang, hong, or kung-hang**
- The central government **authorized the cohong to trade with Western merchants** specifically at **Guangzhou (Canton)**
- When Guangzhou became the **only Chinese port open to foreign trade in 1757**, the hong merchants were the **only merchants in the city permitted to sell commodities like tea and silk to Westerners**
- Theoretically, the number of merchants was **13**, although they frequently numbered **no more than 4**
- A critical function was established in the **1740s**. A system required that every foreign ship arriving at Guangzhou had to be **supervised by a hong merchant**.
- This designated hong merchant served as a guarantor to the Chinese government, ensuring both the **payment of all duties** and the **proper behaviour of the foreign traders**.
- Despite being subject to **heavy exactions from officials**, some hong merchants were able to accumulate **great wealth**

Effects on the Domestic Economy and Society 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/23891200?seq=1
- **Government Revenue and Merchant Roles:** The thirteen Chinese **hong merchants** (organized as the Cohong in 1720) were essential to the system, benefiting both the Qing government and foreign traders. They were responsible for collecting **customs dues and taxes for the Qing government**
- **Protection against Official Exactions:** The Cohong merchants established the **Consoo fund in 1775**. Each member contributed ten percent of his trade profits to this fund, which was intended to protect the members from the financial "exactions" of Qing officials
- **Widespread Participation in Commerce:** Canton was described as a "contact zone" with a culture that was both local and international. While most Chinese living within the city walls never met a foreigner, most of those _outside_ the walls participated directly in commercial activities with foreigners.
- **Trade Volume and Flexibility:** The trade volume resulting from the Canton System was immense, perhaps unrivaled globally. Despite the official restrictions, China's external trade under the Canton System was often more free than usually assumed, not confined strictly to Canton or entirely monopolized by the Cohong. This flexibility was achieved because foreign traders often dealt with smaller Cantonese merchants outside the official system, traded directly along the coast, and utilized Chinese smugglers as intermediaries.


- **Tolerance of Daily Services:** Although only specially licensed Chinese were officially allowed contact with foreigners, the situation in day-to-day practice was different. **Barbers, washwomen, prostitutes, and others were allowed to engage the seamen on a regular basis**. This was tolerated because these services kept foreigners content, which helped maintain harmony.
