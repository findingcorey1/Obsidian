Term paper writing:  
- You are required to submit a research essay of 4-5 pages (1000-1500 words, double spacing printed). This  
essay should treat some important themes in Chinese history and culture (until 19th centuries). In  
addition, a bibliography sheet should be attached to the essay. A good research essay involves the  
bringing together of facts and ideas using precise and meaningful language and a formalized structure.  
- Clear understanding of the relevant issues in an assigned topic and the ability to see their relationship to  
the course content.  
- Sources: You are expected to use academic sources – articles, papers, books (including online): аt least  
five non-encyclopedic sources. You can use few AI (ChatGPT and other) sources, with required citation.  
Primary sources also can be used but they are not required.  
- Argument: First, remember that when writing a research essay you are putting forward an argument or  
answering a question, not just listing facts or writing a chronology of events. Consider all possibilities,  
identify and weigh the importance of each factor, and come to your own conclusion. The resulting thesis  
or argument is the centrepiece around which you marshal and organize the evidence and ideas for your  
essay. A clear statement of the argument should appear near the end of the introduction of the essay, eg.  
"This paper will attempt to demonstrate that...." or "This paper argues that....."  
- Narrative (story): you are expected to provide examples to articulate your argument. It is recommended  
to use subtitles for better structure and flow of the narrative.  
- Planning: Formulate a concise title for your essay that crystallizes its purpose and approach. Then  
construct a plan that will enable you to proceed. Identify relevant sources, prepare notes and formulate  
an outline for the essay. Don't worry if you find that your ideas, argument or even your essay title require  
modification along the way: this is a natural and expected component of the research process.

- Full, critical engagement with the issues presented in primary and secondary source materials.  
Engagement is demonstrated by the effort to understand and internalize the issues through serious  
questioning and examination of the evidence.  
- Quotations are not introduced and “left hanging”; rather, the ideas in them are examined critically and  
are integrated into the larger argument. Mastery of paraphrasing techniques is evident (with appropriate  
documentation). Plagiarism is a serious academic offence which can result in failure or suspension from  
the college. Avoiding plagiarism requires that you acknowledge, by means of citation, the words and ideas  
of others. Use quotations sparingly to highlight or illustrate a specific focus or point. Otherwise, use your  
own words. Develop your own ideas rather than paraphrasing those of others. On occasions when you do  
need to refer to the ideas of others, even if you choose not to use a direct quotation, you must provide a  
citation. Your essay must conform to accepted standards of academic style. References should follow a  
consistent and accepted format, as should the bibliography of sources which you must include at the end  
of the paper. For further details you may consult a style guide.  
- Careful grounding of assumptions in a socio-historical context. Broad statements about a subject are  
particularized and sketchy generalizations avoided.  
- Evidence of skill in analyzing, comparing and contrasting, integrating and synthesizing to express  
significant ideas in an original way. The writer is able to move back and forth between the concrete  
particulars of a question and its abstract significance in order to give full expression to her/his findings.  
Based on the above, the general criteria for letter grades will reflect the following:  
Besides the content, here’s what I will be looking for in your paper:  
1. Does the introduction outline the basics of the argument?  
2. Does the paper progress in a logical and coherent manner?  
3. Do paragraphs have main ideas followed by explanation and supported with discussion and  
information?  
4. Are terms defined clearly and accurately?  
5. Are all borrowed ideas clearly referenced?  
An A essay: demonstrates the above skills and qualities to a high degree; is correctly written with few or no errors  
in grammar, spelling, diction, punctuation; uses a recognized scholarly form of documentation; shows knowledge  
of the conventions appropriate to the type of essay (argument, description, narrative, analysis, etc.); is written in a  
way that facilitates the reader’s engagement with the issues under discussion.  
A B essay: demonstrates some of the qualities listed above; is for the most part correctly and coherently written,  
but contains some errors in writing and scholarly form that obstruct the reader’s easy comprehension of the essay;  
is less sophisticated in its articulation of the core issues posed by the source materials; does not explain the issues  
as fully as a reader might require in order to understand them.  
A C essay: shows only intermittent evidence of the qualities and skills listed above; contains numerous errors in  
writing and documentation; may begin with a thesis or focus but is not able to sustain it consistently or coherently;  
requires substantial effort on the part of the reader to understand it.  
A D essay: lacks focus or argument; has not dealt with the assigned topic; contains a number of major writing  
errors (e.g. incomplete sentence, persistent misuse of words, unidiomatic phrases, paragraph fragments, etc.);
