### **Thesis Statement:**

**“Between 1700 and 1800, Qing China experienced remarkable economic growth driven by agricultural expansion and internal commerce, yet its restrictive trade policies—most notably the Canton System—revealed a tension between self-sufficiency and emerging global economic integration.”**

### **I. Introduction**

- Briefly introduce the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) and the 18th century as a “high point” of stability and prosperity.
    
- Mention the global context: rise of European maritime trade and early industrial capitalism.
    
- End with your thesis statement (above).

### **II. Agricultural Expansion and Population Growth**

- The Qing economy remained primarily **agrarian**.
    
- Advances in farming techniques (such as double-cropping rice) and new world crops (like maize and sweet potatoes) increased food supply.
    
- China’s population nearly **doubled**, from about 150 million to over 300 million.
    
- This agricultural success fueled **domestic markets and tax revenues**.

### **III. Domestic Trade and Market Integration**

- China developed **extensive internal trade networks**: river transport, regional specialization, and market towns.
    
- Silver became the main currency, stabilizing commerce.
    
- Urban centers like **Beijing, Nanjing, and Suzhou** flourished as commercial and cultural hubs.
    
- Merchants—though socially ranked low—became economically influential.

### **IV. Foreign Trade and the Canton System**

- The Qing government restricted foreign trade to the **Canton (Guangzhou)** port under the **Canton System (1757–1842)**.
    
- Foreign merchants (especially British) could only trade through licensed Chinese merchants known as the **Cohong**.
    
- China exported **tea, silk, and porcelain**, receiving large inflows of **silver**.
    
- This trade imbalance favored China but caused growing frustration in Europe.

### **V. Economic Tensions and Global Impact**

- The Qing viewed itself as **economically self-sufficient**, discouraging foreign influence.
    
- The British demand for Chinese goods led to a silver drain in Europe.
    
- By the late 18th century, tensions over trade restrictions contributed to diplomatic strains (e.g., the **Macartney Mission of 1793**).
    
- These tensions set the stage for **the Opium Wars** and China’s later integration into the global capitalist system.

### **VI. Conclusion**

- Restate how Qing China’s prosperity in the 18th century was built on agriculture and managed trade.
    
- Emphasize the **contrast between internal success and external resistance to change**.
    
- Conclude that this balance between tradition and global connection defined China’s economic identity before the 19th-century crises.
