The Warring States period existed between 403-221BC, and it also at the time during the Later Eastern Zhou period. It was called the Warring States because of the constant military conflicts that occurred, and it was becoming more deadly. By that time, the Zhou king was not a major contributor, and later all the smaller states were conquered, and they also took over 6 of the largest ones. During this time, it was the time of great innovation and technologies, as the introduction of iron casting, infantry armies, private ownership, and social mobility. At this time, the Chinese bronze making was at its peak, being able to make intricate designs, and each thing was strong and heavy as well. Also, this time, iron making was a big deal because there were more than 200 workmen employed to help in the great smelter and in turn, more entrepreneurs were developed at this time due to their craftsmanship and things they were able to provide. At this time, those were called the ironmongers. At this time, as well, there was a development of the seven warring states, some notable ones being Qin and Zhao. Also, written scripts were involved as the modern form using an archaic clerical script, but that didn't happen until the late Warring States period.
