Wu Ding played a significant role in the Chinese dynasty as he was the earliest figure in history who had been confirmed by contemporary records as the 11th king of the Shang Dynasty who reigned from 1250-1192 BCE. At that time, Wu Ding had married many wives, one of the significant ones being Fu Hao, who was a military general and high priestess. At the time, Wu Ding was deeply involved in military campaigns, ritual practices, and even personal matters relating to Fu Hao. At the time, Wu Ding had used bones several times to make predictions about whether anything would happen next or to see what would happen after a fortune-telling was made. From all that, the only things that were recorded were a death and a hunting accident. After the discovery of Fu Hao's tomb, there was a lot to be said about Wu Ding. There have been lots of weapons and bronze ritual vessels, which led to say that Wu ding not only had the power to carry powerful weapons but also a powerful priest who could fortune tell. Wu Ding also has lots of goods to trade with other regions and businesses with many neighbouring regions.
