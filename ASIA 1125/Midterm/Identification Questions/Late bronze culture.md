The Late Bronze Age highlighted a lot of the strongest bronze figures and other sorts of crafts during this time. It occurred during the times of the late Shang dynasty and Zhou dynasty, during those times they made tons of bronze artifacts like two-handle bronze vessels, bronze axes, and bronze vessels that were over thousands of pounds. At that time, what stood out the most were the quality and craftsmanship, the decorations that were engraved onto the vessel, the many different shapes and sizes, and, with how widely available bronze was at the time, they were mostly used for sacrificial rituals. Given that it was called the Late Bronze culture, they were at a point where any more significant improvement could have been made in terms of the use of the bronze material itself. Compared to the early period, it had shown that the bronze vessels were very thin compared to now, which they had come a long way. All this was known because, during a recent discovery, over 300 pieces of bronze items were found in a tomb from the Shang era, further supporting the history. With the discovery of the massive amount of bronze artistry follows and matches up to the later Chinese era of complex designs and perfection.
