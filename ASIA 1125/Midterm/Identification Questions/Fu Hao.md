Most of the things dating back to Fu Hao were not found within the inscriptions themselves, but within the tomb she was buried in at Anyang. The most shocking thing was not being able to find the bones of her body, but rather finding all the artifacts that were buried inside the tomb. In this tomb, there were a total of 460 bronze objects, ranging from weapons, bells and knives. There were many jade objects, stone sculptures and bone hairpins that were all in the style of the metropolitan. It was said that the king Wu Ding had made many fortune telling on Hao's illnesses and pregnancies, which made to believe it was a very big deal back then. Also, it was told she led many military campaigns as she was the military leader, being in charge of specific rituals and leading 13,000 troops to fight against those in the east and the west. Lady Fu Hao played a very significant role during the Shang Dynasty and as well as the Wife of Wu Ding, evidence of the influence on how a women can play a huge part in the early Chinese History.
