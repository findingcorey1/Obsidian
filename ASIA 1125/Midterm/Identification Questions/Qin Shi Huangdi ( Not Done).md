Based on the text provided, Qin Shi Huangdi's significance lies in his foundational role as the unifier of China and the architect of a centralized imperial system that endured for over two millennia. By conquering the six other Warring States, he ended centuries of conflict and created a political entity whose basic geography and concept of unity have defined China ever since.

His most profound legacy was the comprehensive system of standardization he imposed to consolidate this unity. He replaced feudal hereditary rule with a **meritocratic bureaucracy**, dividing the empire into administrative commanderies and counties governed by appointed officials. This revolutionary model of centralized governance became the blueprint for all subsequent dynasties. Furthermore, he enforced universal standards for **currency** (the circular coin with a square hole), **script** (Small Seal script), weights, measures, and even cart axles. This eliminated practical and cultural barriers between the former states, fostering economic integration and a common written culture that bound the empire together.

However, his significance is also defined by his tyrannical methods. The massive mobilization of labor for projects like roads and walls, the **burning of books** to suppress dissent, and the harsh Legalist policies created a model of absolute, autocratic rule. This combination of visionary unification and ruthless control cemented his legacy. Ultimately, the over-centralization and brutality that enabled his achievements also led to the Qin Dynasty's swift collapse after his death, serving as a permanent lesson for future rulers about the dangers of excessive tyranny, even as they adopted the administrative framework he created.

Qin Shi Huangdi at the time was the King of Quin back in 247-220 BCE but then later he had reached his climax by taking over the late Zhou Dynasty and created a big empire. During that time Qin was the Emporer at Zhou, in order to prove his worth of the emperor there, he toured the empire 5 times between 220-210 BCE to show the power he had and can bring to the table and as well offerings to the spirits to bring those a safe place to stay.
