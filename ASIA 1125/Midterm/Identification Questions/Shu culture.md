Shu culture play a big role during the Shang and Zhou dynasties between 1600 - 256 BCE. At the time they are most notable for their unique bronze artifacts made to resemble bronze mask, figures, and sacred trees. At the time they have made lots of bronze figures which resemble and reflect a lot of animals like birds and snakes but they do not directly represent them. It was also uncommon for figures and bronze images to show human beings and if there were any human beings in it, they associated with the images of animals as well. Some have later expressed that the implementation of animals in their bronze figures meant several things, some say that they were like a resemblance to sacrifice those animals that were hunted and killed for food and later on would be offered as a sacrificial honoring. Others think that they created it as a form of worshiping certain types of animals that had been descended for other particular animals in its time in the form of totemism. Another major significance were their sacrificial alters, where it consisted of 3 levels, the bottom later had animals sculpted out, second layer had 3 standing humans supporting hills on their head, and lastly at the top had human figures with birds as the head. This structure overall signified the vertical order of man, earth and heaven.
