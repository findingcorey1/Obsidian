The significance of the cognitive revolution started back at approximately 70,000 years ago where homo sapiens had started to develop more elaborate structures called culture. Each culture varied in things they did and the stuff they created. This is show through what we called history, which was a development of the human culture. History is the story of how human societies, including their beliefs, behaviors, and traditions, have changed over time. At that time the sapiens language was straightforward and easy to dissect from their simple signs and sounds they make, from that they can make numerous amounts of sentences and all with different meanings to it. One significant leap was around 70,000 years ago, known as the behavioral modernity and it states that traits such as cognitive and behavioral distinguish homo sapiens sapiens from other modern humans. Some of the certain traits that distinguish the homo sapiens vary from figurative arts like cave paintings, bone tools, transportations, and fireplaces. The figurative arts that were shown during the cognitive revolution were first found during this period and it was the first evidence of religion and social stratification. This lead to further show new appearances of new ways of thinking and further build on their communicative revolution.
