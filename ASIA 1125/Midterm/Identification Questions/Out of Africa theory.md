The out of Africa theory was a widely accepted theory, thoroughly explaining that homo sapiens were first evolved from Africa and soon after migrated to many parts of the world like China. From this theory we can tell this was true because researchers had found homo sapiens around east Asia around 100,000 years ago, which were spread across Africa. From the theory it was also shown that homo sapiens had stated to migrate of of Africa around 70,000 years ago towards areas like Asia. From there fossils and skulls have been discovered around Asia dating back to around 50,000 years ago in China, 40-45,000 years ago in Korea, and  38,000 years ago in Japan. From there we the theory explained that the homo sapiens who migrated started to interbreed with one another therefore growing and expanding the population. As of right now, it has been told that the Mitochondrial Eve is the most recent common ancestor as of all living humans at this moment. The theory explains that while there was limited interbreeding, Homo sapiens ultimately replaced these other species. It has been highlighted that there was a big emphasis on our shared recent ancestry and the profound role that Africa had played as the cradle of all humankind.
