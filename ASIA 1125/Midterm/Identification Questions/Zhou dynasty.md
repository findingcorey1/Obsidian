The Zhou Dynasty occurred between 1046-256 BCE; its significance played a role in the Chinese evolution most arguably greater than the Xia or Shang Dynasties, in terms of core political and philosophical ideas that would define the Chinese civilization going forward. The First phase of the Zhou period was described as the Western Zhou (Dating back from 1046-770 BCE) because the capital was in the west, so they had started there. At the same time, Zhou was also in alliance with Qiang, who at the time had conquered the Shang. The biggest contribution during this time was the introduction to the concept of "Mandate of Heaven", It was there to justify and explain the rulership of overthrowing Xia and Shang. From then on forward, Zhou had set an example and built the foundational principle to the succeeding dynasties that occurred after Zhou to prove their legitimacy for defeating the previous dynasty. Another key point during the Zhou era was that Zhou was the first to create a book of documents (shujing), deemed of the Confucian classics containing text from the early beginnings of Zhou and listing the history of what had happened through their own writing. To summarize, the Zhou dynasty had paved the way for Chinese governance, historical writings, and political theories as a framework for the next dynasties after its fall.
