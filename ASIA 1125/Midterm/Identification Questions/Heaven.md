Heaven was one of the key points in early spiritual practices; it was conceived as something like the sacred moral power of the cosmos. In heaven, there were many other spirits, including various nature spirits and the most significant one being heaven itself, which many see as the powerful god that is above them. In order to communicate with those who are there, they transmit text and bronze inscriptions to them, and it was said that Zhou's King was related to heaven at the time. It was said that for the King to rule the dynasty, they must follow rules that the ones in heaven entail. If they decide to disobey those orders or neglect their duties, it is said that heaven would send down natural disasters or signs and omens to haunt them for the rest of their life or till their dynasty is destroyed.Â  Humans are also linked to heaven in a way that when they die and their spirits have left their bodies, they can ascend to heaven. At the same time are not able to do so because some of the elements that hold those spirits down to earth, for example, their personality of the soul and body.
