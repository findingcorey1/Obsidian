The Longshan culture started in 3000-2000 BCE and was transformative in the late Neolithic period. It was said to be essential in terms of social, political, and cultural groundwork for the Chinese civilization. Before the Neolithic period, all the villages were built very simply with mud bricks and circular huts, but it later shifted into more complex pit houses. One key thing that was significant to the Longshan culture was that they were the first to have graves since ever since the farmers had built farms and villages, and were not able to build them near them, so they had to have them buried in cemeteries outside the villages. At that same time, each grave was different from the others because some were classified as elite burials and they became more elaborate. Some of the Rich graves had many expensive items ranging from necklaces and bracelets made from jade, stone and pottery beads. From that it was revealed a clear social hierarchy and a segmentary lineage system that was present. Another key point is that the Longshan culture was very innovative for its era; the Longshan culture had developed an advanced pottery design, ranging from different shapes and sizes and different engraving on the pottery itself. They were also innovative in their cooking tripods, as they spread west while other things like geometric design and decorations had spread east.
