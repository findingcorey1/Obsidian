The Shang Dynasty started during 1600-1046 BCE, being one of the last of the three dynasties, which included the Xia, Shang, and Zhou Dynasties. It holds a historical era for the Chinese civilization because of the contemporary written records. Most of thing things at the time were written on inscriptions of oracle bones, which makes it easy to date back to what happened during the dynasty. The inscriptions not only talked about the king, but they also revealed ancestor worship, fortune telling, and the hierarchical social orders. At the time, Shang had lots of materials and was very technological with sharing from neighbouring regions. Some major things included horse-drawn chariots, two-handled bronze vessels, bronze axes, and shell and bone inscriptions. At the beginning of the Shang around 1500 BCE, it was a major transformation for that state because it expanded outwards to rule the neighbouring territories. But later on in 1300 BCE, the state retreated because of the immense amount of pressure being put on them due to newer polities that formed in the surrounding borders. Also, during the later half of the Shang Dynasty, Wu Ding played a significant role in the Chinese dynasty as he was the earliest figure in history who had been confirmed by contemporary records as the 11th king of the Shang Dynasty who reigned from 1250-1192 BCE.
