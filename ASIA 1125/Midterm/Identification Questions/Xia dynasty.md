The Xia period dates back as far as 2060 - 1600 BCE, It was said that it closely resembled the Erlintou culture back in 1900BCE, but at the same time, it was highly debated. Its dating was at a weird point due to it roughly overlapping with the Xia timeline, and it being located in the middle of the Yellow River Basin made it somewhat confusing. During this time, there were lots of urban centers, grand complexes, bronze casting workshops, and early signs of state-level civilization. During this time, it was said that the Xia dynasty was established by "Yu the Great" and was succeeded by his son. He was well known for the system of flood control. At first, Yu declined the throne, but with the much attention he was getting from other local lords and chiefs that he later agreed to take on the role as the new emperor at the age of 53. Yu was believed as the man of the common people; he projected a renowned status and was referred to in Chinese history as "Great Yu controls the waters". Yu also divided the realm into 9 regions and had bronze vessels cast to represent each region.
