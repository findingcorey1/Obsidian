The Jade Emperor, also known as Yu Huang Dadi, was an important and powerful figure in the early history of China. He is known for ruling Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld. His story was that he functioned as a cosmogonic myth, the myth being about the beginning of the universe and the world's order. They mentioned that he was once a prince known for his relative kindness, compassion, justice, morality, and that he practiced virtue for thousands of years to get to the role. Through the virtue that he had practiced for years, he was chosen by the Heavenly hierarchy to rule the universe and the worldâ€™s order. When he rose to the Jade Emperor, he had many duties to fulfill. As stated before, he was the ruler of many universes as well as gods, spirits, and humans. He appeared as what people had imagined him: a calm, dignified, majestic, powerful figure in imperial robes who ruled the universe and whom no one would dare to harm. His court, the Heavenly court, was similar to the Chinese court. They both had people surrounding each other with ministers, generals, scribes, and inspectors who would punish criminals and reward those who did good deeds.
