The Erlitou Culture first dated back to 1900 -1500 BCE, and it held immense significance as the earliest state level society in China. At that time, they were forming a crucial structure between the late Neolithic Longshan culture and later Shang dynasty. Erlitou was centred in Henan and Shanxi Province, but later on their culture spread across to Shaanxi and Hubei Province. At that time their significance were leading the production of ritual bronze vessels, some most notably wine vessels (known as jue) and cauldrons. The earliest bronze vessels were dated about 1700BC in the province of Henan, which was during the Xia dynasty. At that time, Bronze production was relatively still new and less advanced due to the limited amount of locals who produced the bronze items, but when they did, it was mostly made into cups and vessels. The vessels found there were very thin, as thin as 1mm. It also included complex shapes, sharp angles and crimped edges; it almost looks like it was made from a sheet-metal prototype of the modern day technology. But eventually, the bronze vessels were significantly improved later in the Shang time. This culture represented the foundations and stage for the following dynasties to later on improve on the bronze production.
