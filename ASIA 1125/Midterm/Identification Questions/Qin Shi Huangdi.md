in Shi Huangdi, at the time, was the King of Qin back in 247-220 BCE, but then later he reached his climax by taking over the late Zhou Dynasty and created a big empire. During that time, Qin was the Emperor of Zhou. To prove his worth as the emperor there, he toured the empire 5 times between 220-210 BCE to show the power he had and could bring to the table and as well as offerings to the spirits to bring those a safe place to stay. Also during this time, Qin had invented and given himself a new title, Huangdi (August God), and he proclaimed himself either as August god or Shi Huangdi. Later, he must be followed by being called the Second August god for the next thousand generations. During those time he developed and conquered many regions and proved that he was a worthy king, at the time he emphasized that farming was one of the mainstay of the economy, Qin offered many new migrants with empty lands and houses as a welcoming, here it made farming very easy as they had access to large acres of land but the only downside to it was the Qin state had control of them and any wrong move or something he did not like, he was liable for it. Also at this time, he divided the territory into regional units, also known as commanderies. At first, it started at 36 but later on increased to 42 units.
