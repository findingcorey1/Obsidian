Yang Shang had a significant role in building the empire alongside Shi Huangdi, as he was the Legalist (known as Law Expert) and also the chief minister of the state of Qin. During that time, it was known that Qin had adopted the Legalist policies the most fully compared to the others. During that time, it was known that he had helped develop a hierarchy of military titles and awarded them to those with the number of heads cut off during battle. When the state was later divided into different counties, each one had its own appointed officials, and those were from the military from the war. It was also known that when it was divided into counties, each one had interlocking units; some houses had 5 to 10 households, while other units were formed as a larger unit, for example, like Xian. Xian was provided with local government services and as well as providing local government services, and carried out armies. Those armies had to carry out public work, collect taxes and administer justice to those within the county. In the inscriptions and books, it described Lord Shang as having lots of respect for traditions and told the ruler not to hesitate in institutional changes to strengthen the state.
