# Discussion 4: Zhou dynasty

For this week’s discussion, please choose **one question from the reading** and **one question from the film** below (total two answers), and share your reflections in the thread.

1. Reading (Eberly, _The Cambridge Illustrated History of China_, pp. 32–45)**:**

- What was the origin of the Zhou dynasty?
- How was the realm structured during the Western Zhou period?
- How can you describe the Bronze culture of this era?
- What changed in the power structure during the Eastern Zhou?

How can you descirbe the bronze culture of this era?

- During the Zhou dynasty era the bronze culture was very impactful, with the most notable being Duke Huan of Qi (685-643 BCE), during that time him and Guan Zhong built Qi’s economic strength by casting coins that were circular with square cutout holes (able to string together for easier carrying and counting) and later with that they were able to control prices of everything and also regulating the prodcution of salt and iron tools. At that time the bronze were also made into the shapes of knifes and spades as well.

2. Film – _Hero_ (2002)

As you watch, consider these questions:

- In what ways does the film change or reinterpret historical events (e.g. Qin’s unification, assassination attempts)?
- The film presents multiple versions of the same events through “stories within stories.” How does this affect your sense of what is _true_?
- What is the relationship between swordsmanship and calligraphy (or the warrior ethos and the arts)?
- How is the King of Qin portrayed? What are his strengths, vulnerabilities, and fears?
- What can we learn from the film’s portrayal of Qin’s military about its role and significance during the Warring States period?
- The King of Qin argues that only a strong central ruler can end the ceaseless wars among states. What are the risks of that claim?
- Several characters are driven by familial loss, revenge, loyalty, or love. How do these personal feelings influence their decisions?
- The final text in _Hero_ refers to “All Under Heaven” (天下). How does this concept echo through traditional Chinese political thought and connect to modern ideas of national unity?

Looking forward to your insights on how history, philosophy, and art intersect in both the readings and the film.

What is the relationship between swordsmanship and calligraphy?

- The relationship between both swordsmanship and calligraphy requires patients, mental/spiritual/physical discipline. When comparing calligraphy, it requires mental discipline due to eat stroke must be requires the calligrapher to be still and open minded in order for them to have their meanings and energy flow through with each stroke from the brush. It can be the same when applied to swordsman's, in order for them to fight, they must have clear mental and physical state in order for them to perfect their stance and predict their opponents next strike. In the film it portrays this in the broken sword scene where each swing they take requires a precise and the energy required each strike.
