### 1. What passage best captures Confucius’s idea of the junzi (noble person), and why?

While many passages describe the _junzi_, a particularly comprehensive and illuminating one is **4:16**:

> _The Master said: “The noble man is aware of fairness, the inferior man is aware of advantage.”_

**Why this passage?**  
This single sentence captures the fundamental moral orientation of the _junzi_. It's not about a list of specific behaviors, but about a core mindset. The _junzi_'s actions are guided by _yi_ (righteousness, fairness, moral rightness), an objective standard of what is proper. In contrast, the small-minded person is driven by self-interest and personal profit (_li_). This distinction underpins all other characteristics of the _junzi_ found elsewhere in the text:

- **He is not a utensil (2:12):** He is not a narrow specialist but a generalist whose virtue is adaptable.
    
- **He is all-embracing and not partial (2:14):** His sense of fairness prevents him from factionalism.
    
- **He corrects himself (1:8):** His commitment to rightness means he is quick to rectify his own errors.
    
- **He is self-confident without being arrogant (13:26):** His confidence comes from his inner moral integrity, not from comparing himself to others.
    

Therefore, 4:16 serves as the foundational principle from which all other descriptions of the _junzi_ flow.


What picture of Confucius as a teacher and learner emerges from the text?  
    - In the book, they paint Confucius as one who was willing to learn and one who wants to spend the rest of his life doing.   
        - It can be said in [2:14] The Master said: “At fifteen my heart was set on learning; at thirty I stood firm; at forty I had no more doubts; at fifty I knew the mandate of heaven; at sixty my ear was obedient; at seventy I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing the norm.  
        - This quote is a self-reflection of his past at 15 when he first wanted to be a teacher and was standing by it. By the time he was 70, he looked back at his past, stating he followed what his heart wanted to do, and it paid off. He constantly reviewed and refined his understanding, emphasizing that true wisdom grows from reflection and moral efforts.  
    - Confucius was a patient teacher who was willing to only teach those who wanted to learn and think for themselves. He wanted those who would participate and ask questions instead of memorization.  Throughout book 7, he states all these problems and things he saw with his students  
        - One most notable quote in book 7 that illustrates it is,   
          [7:8] The Master said: “If a student is not eager, I won't teach him; if he is not struggling with the truth, I won't reveal it to him. If I lift up one corner and he can't come back with the other three, I  won't do it again.”

Which episode of Confucius’ life stands out in your opinion, and what does it reveal about his philosophy or character?

The most notable part of Confucius' life that stands out to me was that he left his hometown to pursue his principles elsewhere. At the time, he believed that his ideas and principles were more powerful than those Zhou had thought. So he stuck to his own ideas rather than having a comfortable job. For 15 years, he travelled to different states with his students to find a leader to listen to his ideas and beliefs; that type of commitment showed that he was not one to simply give up. Even though he failed to get a powerful political job, he stayed true to his morals and became the most influential teacher in Chinese history. He proved to many about his core ideas by teaching others who were also willing to learn and pass it down to the later generations.
