### 1. What passage best captures Confucius’s idea of the junzi (noble person), and why?

While many passages describe the _junzi_, a particularly comprehensive and illuminating one is **4:16**:

> _The Master said: “The noble man is aware of fairness, the inferior man is aware of advantage.”_

**Why this passage?**  
This single sentence captures the fundamental moral orientation of the _junzi_. It's not about a list of specific behaviors, but about a core mindset. The _junzi_'s actions are guided by _yi_ (righteousness, fairness, moral rightness), an objective standard of what is proper. In contrast, the small-minded person is driven by self-interest and personal profit (_li_). This distinction underpins all other characteristics of the _junzi_ found elsewhere in the text:

- **He is not a utensil (2:12):** He is not a narrow specialist but a generalist whose virtue is adaptable.
    
- **He is all-embracing and not partial (2:14):** His sense of fairness prevents him from factionalism.
    
- **He corrects himself (1:8):** His commitment to rightness means he is quick to rectify his own errors.
    
- **He is self-confident without being arrogant (13:26):** His confidence comes from his inner moral integrity, not from comparing himself to others.
    

Therefore, 4:16 serves as the foundational principle from which all other descriptions of the _junzi_ flow.


What picture of Confucius as a teacher and learner emerges from the text?
	- In the book, they paint Confucius as a one who was willing to learn and one who wants to spend the rest of life doing. 
		- It can be said in [2:14] The Master said: “At fifteen my heart was set on learning; at thirty I stood firm; at forty I had no more doubts; at fifty I knew the mandate of heaven; at sixty my ear was obedient; at seventy I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing the norm.
		- This quote is a self reflection of his past at 15 when he first wanted to be a teacher and was standing by on it. By the time he was 70, he looked back at his past stating he followed what his heart wanted to do and it paid off. He constantly reviewed and refined his understanding, emphasizing that true wisdom grows from reflection and moral efforts.
