This discussion is based on:

- The documentary _The Birth of a Dynasty: China’s First Emperor_ (YouTube) — [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-SC0vKIWV0&t=11s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-SC0vKIWV0&t=11s)
- Eberly, pp. 55–68

**Please choose one question from each part and share your reflections, for a total of two answers.**

**I. Questions (for the Documentary)**

- To what extent was the Qin unification of China driven by ideology (e.g. Legalism) versus pragmatism (control of resources, military strategy, and territorial advantage)?
- What advantages did the Qin state have—geography, resources, reforms, leadership—that allowed it to prevail over rival states?
- Once Qin Shi Huang (King Zheng) unified China, how did he consolidate rule across such a vast and diverse territory?
- What administrative measures (e.g. standardization, centralization, infrastructure, law) most effectively bound the empire together?
- Despite its achievements, the Qin Dynasty was short-lived. Why? What internal weaknesses or external pressures led to its collapse?
- How has later Chinese historiography (and modern scholarship) judged Qin Shi Huang and the Qin dynasty—was he a heroic unifier or a tyrant?
- Which aspects of Qin’s legacy—Legalism, bureaucracy, standardization—endured in later dynasties, and why?

**II. Questions (for the Book, pp. 55–68)**

- Who were “the power strategists” described in the reading, and what were their key ideas?
- What were the differences and similarities among regional cultures during the Warring States period?
- What separated the state of Qin from other central states (in terms of institutions, strategies, ideology, geography, etc.)?
- How do interpretations of Emperor Qin vary in the reading and broader scholarship—was he a great conqueror, a tyrant, or something in between?

Looking forward to your thoughts.
