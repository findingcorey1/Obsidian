Part 1:
Why and how was paper money invented?
- Money was invented because at the time during the Song period, there was a bronze coin shortage and Sichuan only required to use iron coins as the primary form of payment. At the time iron was too heavy and bulky to be used as a currency. With those concerns, it cause a major currency situation which led to the Sichuanese merchants to develop paper money as the new form of payment and it also served as a better way for long distant transactions. The benefit with paper money was that they were able to deposit all the iron coins into the merchant house and in turn get a deposit slip as a promissory notes.

Part 2:
Name one song invention that stood out, and explain why?
- One invention that stood out for the Song Dynasty was the creation of Gunpowder (p. 142). At the time the Song army was rapidly increasing as the size tripled during a very short time of around 50 years. With that it lead to increased manufacturing of huge quantities of military equipment's and over the time the military expenses are over 3 quarters of the states revenue. Another thing that stood out with the invention and creation of gunpowder was that it helped improve their military technology but it was very short lived. Even thought it lead to many creations of a wide range of weapons, siege machines, incendiary grenades made from the gunpowder, and inventing expanding the gunpowder which lead to making very effective cannons, many enemies would in turn capture those engineers who knew how to build those weapons and produce similar or better weapons that can outpower the song army
