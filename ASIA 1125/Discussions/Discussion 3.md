According to the authors, what was the greatest “treasure” in the tomb, and why?

According to the authors, there were many treasures found within the tomb but the greatest treasure found in the tomb were the use of bronze materials. Throughout the tomb, they have found many artifacts made with bronze which signifies the importance and value it has the the Shang culture. There were many artifacts that were made from bronzes, those included drinking vessels and weapons.

According to the authors, the greatest treasure found in the tomb was within the tomb named “M54” . Here the greatest treasure found inside the tomb was the skeleton of the tomb owner. Usually the skeletons are crushed within the tomb itself as the coffin denigrates but with that it gave them many vital information of what it was like back then. Another thing that was apart of the skeleton was finding a hand made with bronze, which to them it suggested that it could be a artificial limb because there was no right hand found within the coffin itself.

What were the features of Shang bronze culture?

There were many features present during the Bronze culture, with the use of bronze materials to show wealth and advantages during war. Something things that were noted during that time were bronze-tipped spears and halberds, composite bows, and horse-drawn chariots. Chariots were of huge significance during the Bronze culture because it helped them during wars by giving them more mobility in the war itself, and they were also able to supervise their troops. During that time, many of the bronze vessels found stood out to other societies because of the quantities they had and the decorations on them as well. There were many of these made, which were in different shapes and sizes, which led them to believe that they were made for sacrificial rituals, in which their king believed at the time.
