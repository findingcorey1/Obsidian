Questions:

1. Which ideas that emerged during the Warring States period remain relevant today, and why?

2. What were the main differences between Mohism and Daoism in their understanding of ethics, governance, and social order?

**What were the main differences between Mohism and Daoism in their understanding of ethics, governance, and social order?**

Ethics
* Mohism:
	* Mozi emphasized “impartial caring” (jian ai 兼愛) — the idea that one should care for all people equally, not just family or friends
	* Ethics was active and interventionist: people were expected to do good and help others
	* Moral goodness was defined by usefulness and benefit to society — an action was good if it promoted collective welfare and reduced harm
* Daoism
	* Daoist ethics focused on harmony with the Dao (the Way) — the natural order of the universe
	* Daoism rejected the very foundations of Confucian and Mohist ethics. It  targets sagehood, humanness, and righteousnes" (Confucian values) and Mozi's "profit" as artificial constructs that interfere with the natural Dao
	* The ideal moral life was spontaneous, effortless, and natural, also known as wuwei. It involves the non-interference, spontaneity, and becoming one with the flow of nature

Governance
* Mohism
	* Advocated for a strong, centralized government led by a ruler who promoted universal welfare by increasing the basic goods of order, wealth, and the population.
	* The ruler’s role was to set moral standards, reward the good, and punish the harmful, ensuring uniform behavior for social harmony
* Daoism
	* Advocated for minimal government and non-interference
	* The ruler practiced wuwei governing by not imposing excessive law or moral codes
	* The best governance is minimal governance, allowing things to follow their own course.

Social Order
* Mohism
	* It is built on the principle of "impartial caring," where everyone has a responsibility toward everyone else. This was a direct challenge to the Confucian focus on familial bonds and hierarchical relationships
	* Social order is created through conscious, deliberate action and the application of a universal ethical standard that transcends the family
* Daoism
	* Social order is not something to be constructed through rules or imposed ethics. It emerges naturally when humans stop trying to control society and instead live in spontaneous harmony with the Dao


Reading: Ebrey, _The Cambridge Illustrated History of China_, pp. 40–63

During the Eastern Zhou period, China experienced deep political fragmentation and rapid social change. This instability encouraged intellectuals to seek new models for moral order, governance, and harmony — giving rise to the so-called _“Hundred Schools of Thought.”_

2. Which later Confucian scholars helped shape and expand Confucianism after Confucius?

Which later Confucian scholars helped shape and expand Confucianism after Confucius?
* Mencius (370-300 BC)
