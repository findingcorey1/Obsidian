Discussion

For our next discussion, we will continue exploring the beginnings of Chinese civilization through two short documentaries (parts 2 and 3 of _The Birth of China_ series, and the textbook reading (_Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China_, chapter 1, pp. 12–23). Please watch/read in advance and reflect on the following questions.

- What impressed you from the origin myths?
- How can you define the natural environment?
- Identify traits of China’s prehistory.

**Important note**: For your responses, please select one question from each section (documentary II, documentary III, and textbook), meaning you will post **three answers in total**.

Looking forward to our discussions — they will help us connect myth, environment, and archaeology in understanding the deep foundations of Chinese civilization.

_The Birth of China II_ – _Farmers of Rice and Millet (7000 BCE - 5000 BCE)_

- What were the features of material culture during this period?
    - Housing
        - Early beginning consisted of pit dwelling/houses that were dug into the earth but another the sizing of the houses varied between cultures. Many had large number of storage pits and organissed burial areas. There were also foundations of rectangular pit houses which were incases in a ditch to prevent defences from other intruders and as a form of flood defence. Many of these were located near water, which included springs, rivers and lakes.
    - Tools/Pottery
        - Many of these items were “unearthed, due to the constant relocating of the residence because of the limited farming lands. There were tools found in pit storages that were remains for crop cultivation. There were still uses of microblaed and flaked tools during (20000 to 7000 BCE) period, many other tools like polished stone tools like axes, adzes, chisels and knives began be used more. Even though these polished stone tools required more time to make, it was far more durbale than the flaked tools making it ideal for woodworking and bigger dwellings. There were also increased use of groundstone spades for plant cultivation and harvesting, as well as multifunctional tools like sickles. Large number of grindstones were present to process plants and other foodstuffs. . Pottery was a big part of the culture, many of the potterys were sand tempered and built by hand using coils of clay and fired at high temperatures in kilns. Many had differet designs as well making it somewhat unique
    - Farming
        - Had many farm animals like domesticated pigs, chicken. Also consumed lots of wild plant species that include nuts, tubers, berries and cereal. A lot of their diet at the time consisted of broomcorn and foxtail millets. Predominant plant specied that were explited in the north were mostly consisted of acorns

What changes in material culture and innovation took place?

- There were many different changes throughout the period which included Transition from microlithic to ground stone tools, including axes, sickles, spades, and harvesting knives, reflecting large-scale agriculture and construction. Pottery production increased in quantity and quality, with painted red slip pottery, geometric patterns, and early use of pottery kilns. Early forms of the potter's wheel appeared in some cultures, enhancing ceramic production. Construction techniques advanced, including rammed earth floors and walls, large wooden post structures, and irrigation systems for rice paddies. Increased production of jade artifacts and elaborately decorated pottery served as prestige goods and symbols of elite status,

- How can you define the natural environment?
    - The environment drastically differs with two great river systems flow east through China with the yellow River in the north and Yangzi River in the center. With the Yellow River, It rises in the western highlands and in that area it has more possibilities of more farmlands and it is highly fertile and easy to work with primitive tools. While with the southern end is covered with yellow with silt which makes it hard for farming. With the other Yangzi river, it would carry great amounts of waters, spanning over hundreds of meters. Which makes it hard for villages to survive due to the constant floodings and flooding many farmlands because of it. But now both rivers had drained and they differ in soil, topography, temperature, and rainfall.
