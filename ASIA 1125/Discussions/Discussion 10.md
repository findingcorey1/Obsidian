Part 1:
 In your opinion, what was the most significant achievement of the Tang dynasty, and why?
* The most significant achievement from the tang dynasty was the creation and the international distribution of the institutional structures, most notably being the tang code and the six boards. The highly successful Tang code was adopted by subsequent Chinese dynasties and neighbors like the Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, while the administrative framework of the six ministries (Revenue, Civil Appointments, Rites, Works, Punishments, and War) was so enduring that it still remained in use until the 20th century. 

Part 2:
What were the main similarities in governance between the Han and Tang?
* Both Dynasties established the structure of a centralized bureaucratic monarchy that was retained throughout Chinese history (p.114) 118
	* Han retained Qin’s principal weapon against the old aristocracy, direct administration through appointed officials 
	*  The Tang Code set out clear rules for officials, reflecting a highly systematized bureaucratic order.” (pp. 111–112)
* Relied on direct administration of position by officials who were centrally appointed and subject to dismissal and transferred a system that was retained by the Han from the qin dynasty (p.64)
* Both had used Confucian ideas to pursue loyalty and responsibilities among officials finding it "much less costly to appoint officials the government could trust than to supervise and monitor their every action" (p.120)
	* Han: Under Emperor Wu, Confucianism became the state orthodoxy, and officials were expected to embody Confucian moral values.” (p. 79-84)
	* Tang: Tang court had supported confucian learning as well
