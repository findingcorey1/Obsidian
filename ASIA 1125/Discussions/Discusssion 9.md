How was the Han dynasty different from the Qin dynasty?

The Han dynasty were different from Qin dynasty in both the style of ruling and governing philosophy. While the Qin ruled harshly through strict legal laws severe punishments, the Han kept some of the Qin legal system but softened it, in which it let those to pay fines instead of receiving brutal punishments and the most gruesome penalties were eventually removed as well. Qin had eliminated regional nobles and forced them to live in the capital, but the Han restored a noble class, giving land and titles to family members and trusted followers
Ideology was a major difference between Han and Qin dynasty, At the time under Emperor Wu, Han adopted Confucianism as the state philosophy and promoted education, creating imperial schools and an academy to train officials, whereas the Qin emphasized Legalism. At the time Han also promoted talented commoners into government positions rather than relying solely on hereditary power and later required officials to take examinations. In the end the Han dynasty was ruled with more flexible, lenient and culturally supportive approach rather than Qin's harsh strategies.

What was the role of Emperor Wu of Han in the empire’s expansion, reforms, and military campaigns?
Emperor Wu of Han fundamentally transformed the empire by launching an aggressive military campaign to end the appeasement of the Xiongnu, developing a powerful cavalry to defeat them and securing the Hexi Corridor, which doubled Han territory and established control over the Silk Road. Domestically, he centralized power by weakening regional rulers and endorsing Confucianism as the state philosophy, founding an Imperial University to create a unified bureaucratic elite. However, his prolonged wars drained the treasury, and his later reign was marked by paranoia and a tyrannical search for immortality, mirroring the first Qin emperor he sought to surpass.

Who is Wang Mang, and what factors contributed to his usurpation and the subsequent downfall or disruption of the Han dynasty?
Wang Mang was a Confucian scholar and a powerful relative of the Han imperial family. Wangs rose to popularity from the widespread disappointment with the corruption and incompetence of the later Han emperors. He built popular support by presenting himself as a virtuous and humble reformer opposed to the corrupt court, even receiving a petition with hundreds of thousands of signatures supporting him. Wangs ruling had later ended due to his incompetent, old fashion restructures and importantly, the yellow river flood that triggered the massive peasant rebellion. Later the Han was restored but Wangs reigning had broke the dynasty's stability, dividing it into Western and Eastern eras
