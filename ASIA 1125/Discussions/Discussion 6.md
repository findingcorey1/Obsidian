What were the goals of early spiritual practices?
  
The goal of early Chinese spiritual practices were the attempts to domesticate humans and build better relationships between the spirit world. The problems that occur when dealing with spirits, especially those involving recently deceased ghosts and distant spirits. Rituals had dual purposes; one consisted of separating the souls from the deceased body and containing the souls in the tomb using rituals, which in turn prevents the souls from haunting the living. The other purpose is to use rituals to transform the souls into an ancestor through the provision of a tablet, a temple name, and regular sacrifices, thereby binding it to support its living descendants.
