### Xia dynasty, c. 2070- c. 1600 BCE
* The Xia dynasty (traditionally dated ca. 2070–1600 BCE) is closely associated with the Erlitou culture (ca. 1900–1500 BCE), but the connection is debated
* The Erlitou culture was discovered in Henan province and represents the earliest large- scale Bronze Age culture in China 
* It featured urban centers, palatial complexes, bronze casting workshops, and evidence of early state-level organization 
* Its dating (roughly overlapping with the traditional Xia timeline) and location (in the middle Yellow River basin, where Xia is said to have ruled) made it a prime candidate
* Most Chinese scholarship treat erlitou as the archaeological reflection of Xia
* Naby western scholars remain more cautious, calling Erlitou simply an early bronze age culture without trying it directly to xia
* One way or another, Erlitou is crucial: it represents the transition from neolithic societies to the earliest state in china, whether or not we call it "xia" 
* Discovered in 1959 by historian Xu Xusheng, the erlitou ruins in luoytang are about 3500 to 3800 years old, which place them in the time period of the late xia or earely shang dynasty (1600 bc to 1046bc)

* According to tradition (Shi ji), the Xia dynasty (2070-1600 BCE) was established by the legendary Yu the Great after Shun, the last of the Five Emperors, gave his throne to him
* Yu devised a system to flod controls that were crucial in establishing the prosperity of the chinese hearland 
	* Yellow river and wei river (building irrigation canals which relieved floodwater into fields, and dredging the riverbeds)
* Yu believed to have been a man of the common people
	* The project renown status, and is referred to in chinese history as "Great tu controls the water"   (大禹治水 Da Yu Zhi Shui)  
* King Shun, who reigned after Yao, was so impressed by Yu’s work that he passed the throne to Yu instead of to his own son

* Yu is said to have initially declined the throne, but was so popular with other local lords and chiefs that he agreed to become the new emperor, at the age of fifty-three
* He established a capital at Anyi, the ruins of which are in modern Xia County in southern Shanxi Province 
* Yu divided the realm into nine provinces (zhou)
* Xia is described as dynasty (Xia benji – Basic annals of Xia), as Yu was succeeded by his son Qi
* Tracing Chinese history from the heroic emperors to the Xia to succeeding dynasties stems from the idea of the Mandate of Heaven: only one legitimate dynasty can exist at any given time (Confucian school in the Eastern Zhou period) – basic concept of imperial historiography
* Is Xia dynasty the beginning of Chinese “history”?
	* In traditional Chinese historiography it is unquestioned because the sequence of the Three Sovereigns (Three August Ones), the Five Emperors and the Three Dynasties (Xia, Shang and Zhou) lay at the root of every Chinese person’s idea of the beginning of Chinese history
	* But later Chinese historiography pointed to the mythical nature of Yu
* Aspects of the Xia are the opposite of emblematic traits of the Shang dynasty: while the Shang represent fire or the sun, birds and the east, the Xia represent the west and water (Sarah Alan)
* The development of this mythical Xia was necessary for the Zhou dynasty, who justified their conquest of the Shang by noting that the Shang had supplanted the Xia
* Peer polity interaction (Renfrew): state formation is intelligible only in terms of multiple units and regions; in China Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties probably overlapped one another rather than succeeding one other through warfare and annihilation
* Sima Qian selected Xia among contemporary polities perhaps because in the earliest part of the Chinese Bronze Age it was the most powerful
* In 2011, Chinese archaeologists uncovered the remains of an imperial sized palace (from about 1700 BCE) at Erlitou in Henan, evidence for Xia dynasty
