### Xia dynasty, c. 2070- c. 1600 BCE
* The Xia dynasty (traditionally dated ca. 2070–1600 BCE) is closely associated with the Erlitou culture (ca. 1900–1500 BCE), but the connection is debated
* The Erlitou culture was discovered in Henan province and represents the earliest large- scale Bronze Age culture in China 
* It featured urban centers, palatial complexes, bronze casting workshops, and evidence of early state-level organization 
* Its dating (roughly overlapping with the traditional Xia timeline) and location (in the middle Yellow River basin, where Xia is said to have ruled) made it a prime candidate
* Most Chinese scholarship treat erlitou as the archaeological reflection of Xia
* Naby western scholars remain more cautious, calling Erlitou simply an early bronze age culture without trying it directly to xia
* One way or another, Erlitou is crucial: it represents the transition from neolithic societies to the earliest state in china, whether or not we call it "xia" 
* Discovered in 1959 by historian Xu Xusheng, the erlitou ruins in luoytang are about 3500 to 3800 years old, which place them in the time period of the late xia or earely shang dynasty (1600 bc to 1046bc)
