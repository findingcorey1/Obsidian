### Xia dynasty, c. 2070- c. 1600 BCE
* The Xia dynasty (traditionally dated ca. 2070–1600 BCE) is closely associated with the Erlitou culture (ca. 1900–1500 BCE), but the connection is debated
* The Erlitou culture was discovered in Henan province and represents the earliest large- scale Bronze Age culture in China 
* It featured urban centers, palatial complexes, bronze casting workshops, and evidence of early state-level organization 
* Its dating (roughly overlapping with the traditional Xia timeline) and location (in the middle Yellow River basin, where Xia is said to have ruled) made it a prime candidate
