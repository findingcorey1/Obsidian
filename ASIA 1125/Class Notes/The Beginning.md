	* Pathleolithic period (old stone age) in archeology, 2.6 million years ago and 10,000 BC, stone age
	* Domestication of fire: some human species used occasionally fire around 800,000 years ago; by 300,000 homo erectus, Neanderthals and homo sapiens were using fire on daily basis
	* The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines
	* Some scholars link to advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track and the growth of human brain (long intestines and large brains are massive energy consumers and its hard to have both)
	* Neolithic period (new stone age), about 10,200 BC
* Out of Africa
	* Sites along Omo River, Ethiopia, yield the earliest fossil evidence for anatomically modern Homo sapiens, about 200,000 years ago 
	* Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans (between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago)
	* Emergence of M and N mitochondrial haplogroups – around 70,00 to 60,000 years ago, migration out of Africa (home sapiens who migrated may have interbred with Neanderthals they encountered)
* Cognitive Revolution
	* Sapiens started to form more elaborate structures (since 70,000 years ago) called cultures 
	* History is the development of human cultures
	* Around 60,000-70,000 years ago Sapiens groups left Africa for second time 
	* The spread out of Africa can be called the first wave of human globalization colonization
	* Around 100,000 years ago some groups of Sapiens migrated north of Levant in Neanderthal territory but failed to secure firm footing and retreated
	* Cognitive revolution started about 70,000 years ago, development of language and communication among humans
	* Sapiens’ language is very supple, connecting limited number of sounds and signs to produce infinite number of sentences, each with distinct meaning
	* Great leap forward about 70,000-60,000 years ago, known as “behavioral modernity” – behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes Homo sapiens sapiens (all humans living today) from other anatomically modem humans (Homo sapiens)
	* Traits of behavioral modernity: burial, fishing, figurative art (cave paintings, figurines), self-ornamentation (jewelry, ochre), bone tools and blade technology, transportation, regionally distinct artifacts, fireplaces
	* The period between 70,000 and 30,000 witnessed invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows and needles (essential for sewing warm clothing)
	* The first objects that can identified as art also date from this period, as the first evidence of religion, commerce and social stratification
	* The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating constitutes cognitive revolution
	* The cognitive revolution allowed sapiens to transmit larger quantities of information about the surrounding world, which in turn made possible carrying out complex actions such as avoiding dangerous animals and hunting
	* Ability to transmit larger quantities of information about sapiens social relations, permitting larger and more cohesive groups, numbering up to 150 individuals (gossip helped creation of more stable bands)
	* Ability to transmit information about things that do not really exist, such as tribal spirits (later nations, corporations, etc.), which allowed cooperation between larger number of strangers and rapid innovation of social behavior
	* Sapiens has been able to revise and adapt behavior rapidly in accordance to the changing needs, which opened the possibility of cultural evolution
	* Modern humans outstripped all other human and animal species in its ability to cooperate and form complex organization
	* Sapiens traded: archeologists excavating 30,000-years-old Sapiens sites in Europe find there seashells from the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, likely a result of long-distance trade, and sites in New Guinea with volcanic glass indicating sea trade from a place 400 km away; Neanderthal sites lack any such evidence

		* Homo Sapien (human)
			* Modern human skull found 40,000 BC; one found in Liujiang is said to be 68,000 years old, but this is disputed (more digging will show if modern humans reached China relatively early or late)
			* Modern humans reached China around 50,000 years ago; the Korean Peninsula – 40-45,000 years ago; and the Japanese archipelago around 35-38,000 years ago
			* Multiregionalism: slightly different kinds of modern humans developed in parallel in several parts of the world
			* Modern Chinese man originates from Chinese territory; find in Xuchang (2007) led to a theory that modem humans originate from  Homo erectus in China
			* A study of 6000 skulls demonstrated that the variations in skull types around the world are consistent with DNA evidence: the dispersals out of Africa in the last 60,000 years wiped the slate clean of all genetic differences that had emerged in the previous half million years; confirms the Africa hypothesis
			* Weather Sapiens are to blame or not, no sooner had they arrived to a new location than the native population became extinct
			* The last remains of homo soloensis (subspecies of homo erectus, found in sites of Solo River, Java) are from 50,000 years ago; homo denisova (Denisova Cave in Siberia, to Southeast Asia) disappeared shortly after; Neanderthals made their exit about 30,000 ago; the last dwarf-like humans vanished from Flores Islands (Indonesia) 12,000 years ago
			* At the time of the cognitive revolution there were about 200 species of large terrestrial mammals (above 50 kg), and at the end of the Neolithic revolution after the last glacial (ice) period only about 100 remained
* Neolithic (agricultural) Revolution
	* During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average every 100,000 years
	* The last ice age ran from 75,000 to 15,000 years ago; about 18,000 years ago the last glacial period gave a away to a period of global warming
	* Temperatures and rainfall rose, climate became suitable for wheat and other cereals (in Middles East and other areas), which multiplied and spread
	* Neolithic revolution: from hunting and gathering to agriculture, domestication of plants and animals 
	* Early centers of agriculture:  the Fertile Crescent (11,000 BC), the Yangtze and Yellow River basins (9,000 BC)
	* The transition to agriculture began around 9500-8500 BCE in the hill country of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran and the Levant
	* Dogs were domesticated 15,000 BCE (Asia and possibly elsewhere); sheep and goats were domesticated by 9000 BCE (Middle East); pigs – 8000 BCE (Middle East and perhaps China); cattle – 8000 (Middle East); peas and lentils around 8000 BCE; horses by 6000 (Central Asia); olive trees by 5000; grapevines in 3500 BCE
	* The people in the Hilly Flanks developed agriculture few thousands years before other regions in the world
	* The wild grasses that the cereals, such as wheat, corn, rice, barley and sorghum, are not spread evenly over the globe
	* Of the 56 grasses with the biggest, most nutritious seeds, 32 grow wild in southwest Asia and the Mediterranean basin; East Asia has only 6 wild species; Central America – 5, Africa south of Sahara and North America – 4 each, South America and Australia – 2 each, and rest of Europe – 1 
	* Hence, it is likely that people (living in large groups) in the Hilly Flanks would domesticate plants and animals before anyone else because they had more promising raw materials to work with
	* People in East Asia domesticated rice millet and pigs; New Guineans tamed sugar cane and bananas; people in Central America domesticated maize and beans
	* Domesticated animals, such as sheep, chickens, donkeys and others, supplied food, materials (skins, wool) and muscle power
	* Transportation, ploughing, grinding and other tasks, performed by humans by that time, were increasingly carried out by animals
	* In most farming societies people focused on plant cultivation and raising animals was secondary, but a new kind of society also emerged in some places, based on raising animals – tribes of pastoralist herders
	* Transition from nomadic to sedentary societies with build-up villages and towns 
	* Personal and land ownership, stratification of societies and hierarchies 
	* With the move to permanent villages and the increase in food supply, the population began to grow
	* Around 10,000 BCE there were 5-8 million modern humans – foragers on the planet, and by 1st century AD there were 1-2 million foragers and 250 million farmers
	* Downside on agricultural revolution was increase of violence: in simple agricultural societies with no political structure beyond village and tribe, human violence was responsible for about 15 percent of death 
	* Food surpluses, combined with new transportation technology enabled more and more people to gather first into large villages, then into towns, and finally into cities, all of them joined together by new kingdoms and commercial networks 
	* Around 8500 BCE the largest settlements were villages such as Jericho with few hundred people; by 7000 a town in Anatolia numbered between 5000 and 10000 people
	* In 3100 BCE the whole lower Nile Valley was united in the first Egyptian kingdom
	* Around 2250 BCE Sargon the Great established the first loose (low-end) empire – the Akkadian 
	* In 221 BCE, Qin state united the Central Kingdoms by conquering them creating the first Qin empire (taxing 40 million subjects for a standing army and complex bureaucracy), and shortly afterwards Rome united the Mediterranean 
	* The cooperation networks (from cities in Mesopotamia to the Qin and Roman empires) were based on imagined orders – beliefs and shared myths 
	* The Code of Hammurabi (1776 BCE) served as cooperation manual for several hundreds of thousands Babylonians
