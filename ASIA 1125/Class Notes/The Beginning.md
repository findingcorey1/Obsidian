		* Significant global warming event (greenhouse earth- significant CO2 level
		* Since the Azolla event of 49 million years ago (80% drop in CO2 by this one phenomenon alone), the Cenozoic (New Life) Era has been a period of long-term cooling – icehouse earth; the Arctic cooled from an average sea-surface temperature of 13 C to today’s −9 C

	* Pathleolithic period (old stone age) in archeology, 2.6 million years ago and 10,000 BC, stone age
	* Domestication of fire: some human species used occasionally fire around 800,000 years ago; by 300,000 homo erectus, Neanderthals and homo sapiens were using fire on daily basis
	* The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines
	* Some scholars link to advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track and the growth of human brain (long intestines and large brains are massive energy consumers and its hard to have both)
	* Neolithic period (new stone age), about 10,200 BC
* Out of Africa
	* Sites along Omo River, Ethiopia, yield the earliest fossil evidence for anatomically modern Homo sapiens, about 200,000 years ago 
	* Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans (between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago)
	* Emergence of M and N mitochondrial haplogroups – around 70,00 to 60,000 years ago, migration out of Africa (home sapiens who migrated may have interbred with Neanderthals they encountered)
* Cognitive Revolution
	* Sapiens started to form more elaborate structures (since 70,000 years ago) called cultures 
	* History is the development of human cultures
	* Around 60,000-70,000 years ago Sapiens groups left Africa for second time 
	* The spread out of Africa can be called the first wave of human globalization colonization
	* Around 100,000 years ago some groups of Sapiens migrated north of Levant in Neanderthal territory but failed to secure firm footing and retreated
	* Cognitive revolution started about 70,000 years ago, development of language and communication among humans
	* Sapiens’ language is very supple, connecting limited number of sounds and signs to produce infinite number of sentences, each with distinct meaning
	* Great leap forward about 70,000-60,000 years ago, known as “behavioral modernity” – behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes Homo sapiens sapiens (all humans living today) from other anatomically modem humans (Homo sapiens)
	* Traits of behavioral modernity: burial, fishing, figurative art (cave paintings, figurines), self-ornamentation (jewelry, ochre), bone tools and blade technology, transportation, regionally distinct artifacts, fireplaces
	* The period between 70,000 and 30,000 witnessed invention of boats, oil lamps, bows and arrows and needles (essential for sewing warm clothing)
	* The first objects that can identified as art also date from this period, as the first evidence of religion, commerce and social stratification
	* The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating constitutes cognitive revolution
	* The cognitive revolution allowed sapiens to transmit larger quantities of information about the surrounding world, which in turn made possible carrying out complex actions such as avoiding dangerous animals and hunting
	* Ability to transmit larger quantities of information about sapiens social relations, permitting larger and more cohesive groups, numbering up to 150 individuals (gossip helped creation of more stable bands)
	* Ability to transmit information about things that do not really exist, such as tribal spirits (later nations, corporations, etc.), which allowed cooperation between larger number of strangers and rapid innovation of social behavior
	* Sapiens has been able to revise and adapt behavior rapidly in accordance to the changing needs, which opened the possibility of cultural evolution
	* Modern humans outstripped all other human and animal species in its ability to cooperate and form complex organization
	* Sapiens traded: archeologists excavating 30,000-years-old Sapiens sites in Europe find there seashells from the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts, likely a result of long-distance trade, and sites in New Guinea with volcanic glass indicating sea trade from a place 400 km away; Neanderthal sites lack any such evidence
