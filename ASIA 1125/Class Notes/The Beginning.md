		* Significant global warming event (greenhouse earth- significant CO2 level
		* Since the Azolla event of 49 million years ago (80% drop in CO2 by this one phenomenon alone), the Cenozoic (New Life) Era has been a period of long-term cooling – icehouse earth; the Arctic cooled from an average sea-surface temperature of 13 C to today’s −9 C

	* Pathleolithic period (old stone age) in archeology, 2.6 million years ago and 10,000 BC, stone age
	* Domestication of fire: some human species used occasionally fire around 800,000 years ago; by 300,000 homo erectus, Neanderthals and homo sapiens were using fire on daily basis
	* The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines
	* Some scholars link to advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track and the growth of human brain (long intestines and large brains are massive energy consumers and its hard to have both)
	* Neolithic period (new stone age), about 10,200 BC
* Out of Africa
	* Sites along Omo River, Ethiopia, yield the earliest fossil evidence for anatomically modern Homo sapiens, about 200,000 years ago 
	* Mitochondrial Eve is the matrilineal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all currently living humans (between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago)
	* Emergence of M and N mitochondrial haplogroups – around 70,00 to 60,000 years ago, migration out of Africa (home sapiens who migrated may have interbred with Neanderthals they encountered)
* Cognitive Revolution
	* Sapiens started to form more elaborate structures (since 70,000 years ago) called cultures
