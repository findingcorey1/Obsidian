# **Schools of Thought**

- **Karl Jaspers called the centuries around 500 BCE the “Axial Age” – they formed as axis around which history turned: “Man, as we know him today, came into being”**
- **Axial Age writings: Confucian and Daoist texts in the East, Buddhist and Jain documents in South Asia, the Greek philosophy and the Hebrew Bible (with its descendants the New Testament and the Koran) in the Mediterranean**

# **Confucianism**

- **Confucianism: The Four Books and Five Classics are the authoritative texts of Confucianism before 300 BCE**
- **Four Books: Great Learning (大學 Da xue), Doctrine of the Mean (中庸 Zhongyong), Analects (論語 Lunyu), Mencius (孟子 Mengzi)**
- **Five Classics: Book of Poetry (詩經 Shijing), Book of Documents (尚書 Shujing), Book of Rites (禮記 Liji), Book of Changes (易經 Yijing), Spring and Autumn Annals (春秋 Chunqiu)**
- **Confucius is credited with having authored or edited many of the classical texts, including the Five Classics**

- **Confucius (551-479 BCE): born in Qufu, Shandong province, Lu state during Spring and Autumn period**
- **Known as Kongzi, Master Kong during his lifetime (Kong Fuzi was adopted by the Jesuits)**
- **Lu took pride with Zhou heritage, as its lords (dukes) were descendants of Duke of Zhou’s brother, but in the 6th century BCE these traditions were undermined when powerful warlord families took over government, marginalizing the ducal house (similar thing happened with Zhou dynasty with the rise of powerful states)**

- **Confucius was born to a man who had the rank of knight (man of service) – the lowest rank in nobility (served as an aid to major aristocratic family)**
- **Confucius’ mother was a concubine and he grew with her family (he was three when his father died)**
- **As a young man, Confucius held low-ranking positions managing accounts and watching over livestock**

- **Confucius began a career as a tutor to young men who wanted to learn art of governance; he was also seeking a position as advisor to a ruler (perhaps attained such position in his native Lu)**
- **His mastery of Zhou cultural forms allowed Confucius to become a teacher of young aristocrats seeking polish, and through their connections, he was able to gain some stature in Lu**
- **He and some of his followers attempted to implement a grand restorationist plan in Lu that would have shifted power back to the ducal house**

- **Shortly after 500 BCE, when Confucius was about fifty, the plan failed, and Confucius was forced to leave his home state**
- **For about fifteen years, he traveled with a retinue of disciples from state to state in eastern China, looking for a ruler who would employ him and adopt the policies he advocated**
- **After traveling to several polities he returned to Lu where he taught until his death in 479 BCE, training young men in the literary, ritual, and musical arts that he saw as central to the culture of the Zhou**

Confucius, Tang dynasty portrait

- **Three themes of Confucius’ time were:**
1) warfare, which had been pervasive among the feudal lords since the devolution of power into their hands;
2) the further devolution of power from the Zhou-appointed feudal houses into the hands of subordinate families that managed to accumulate power locally;**
3) and the rising fluidity of social mobility which this type of open competition for power encouraged, as intelligence and warrior skills in their assistants proved more valuable to competing power-holders than did hereditary pedigree**

- **Confucius emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity**
- **His followers competed with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era (6th-3rd centuries BCE), and were suppressed in favour of the Legalists during the Qin Dynasty**
- **During Han dynasty, Confucius’ teaching received official endorsement and was further developed into a system known as Confucianism**

- **Confucius lived at a time before circulated books were written, his conversations were at first orally transmitted and then written by his students (and their students) – The Analects (“discussions and conversations” or “arranged discourses)**
- **The Analects is the main source for understanding Confucius’ teaching**
- **Confucius liked talking and spent most of his life in conversations**

- **Confucius claimed that he did not introduce new ideas, rather, he was seeking to return the disordered realm to earlier time**
- **The Master sought to end the warfare if his time by restoring the Zhou dynasty in Lu**
- **Eleventh-century-BCE Duke of Zhou was his model of virtue; to restore the moral excellence of the duke’s time by reinstating the system of ritual (the lineage of dukes of Lu had begun with the brother of Duke of Zhou)**

- **Archeology suggests that Confucius knew rather little about the distant duke’s era**
- **It was not the duke but a much later ritual revolution around 850 BCE that had given restrained, carefully graded rites, assigning all members of a broad elite to places in hierarchy**
- **Around 600 BCE rituals had changed again as a few super powerful men began being buried with huge wealth, setting themselves above the rest of the elite**

- **Treasuring Zhou traditions with which he was associated, after the decline of the Zhou royal house the state of Lu had become known as the purest repository of Zhou aristocratic culture**
- **But during the 6th century, these traditions of Zhou were undermined, as powerful warlord families gained increasing control of government and resources in Lu, gradually marginalizing the legitimate ducal house, and distorting the norms of government form and ceremonial ritual that had made Lu distinct**

- **Confucius, educated but not particularly rich shi (gentry scholar), was probably reacting to the second change, idealizing the stable ritual order that flourished between 850 and 600 BCE and projecting it back onto the Duke of Zhou**
- **To follow the ritual meant to practice humanness (_ren_): caring more about the living family than about ancestors; valuing honest reverence over showy sanctimony; esteeming virtue, not descent; performing rituals accurately and with simple equipment; and following precedent**

- **But Confucius innovated: he taught students how to behave virtuously and how to govern; in the antiquity, it was believed that sons of high-ranking families were born with that knowledge**
- **Confucius introduced something new in the concept of ritual: his contemporaries used the term for specific rituals, while Confucius recognized abstract quality common to them that applied to the forms of social interactions**

- **If men could learn to employ this quality, society could be reformed**
- **The ritual (_li_ 礼)offered the best opportunity for individual to develop his own humanness (_ren_ 仁) – an essential quality which is also translated as “benevolence”, “perfect virtue”, “goodness”, “exemplary humanity” and “manhood at its best”**

- **The reasons why rituals work involve several diﬀerent elements: one theme is that of reﬁnement – through the practice of ritual, humans reﬁne their dispositions such that they learn to respond to situations in ways that help those around them be better human being**
- **Through rituals: movement from dispositions (nature) to propriety – responding to things properly, instead of by immediate disposition**
- **A second recurring theme is one of extension: this involves taking certain patterns of behavior or particular dispositions and extending them into other domains**

- **Rituals allow one to take feelings one has for immediate kin and extend these to strangers and aspects of the natural world**
- **Practitioners thus come to see ghosts as ancestors and see the ruler as both father and mother, as well as the Son of Heaven**
- **Therefore, in what was once a world of competing families, in a cosmos perceived to be at best indiﬀerent to humanity and perhaps governed by capricious spirits, rituals create a world in which humans come to think of the entire cosmos as a family**

- **It is a fractured and fragmented world, and it will always be so**
- **The notion is that one never creates a full unity, but one can, through ritual, develop more productive ways of connecting with other people and with the larger world**
- **Such a project is never-ending, but, when it works, it can, for periods of time, create pockets of order in which humans can flourish**

- _**Yi**_ **(義/义) is translated as “righteousness”, “justice”, “meaning”; _li_ (ritual) is the action which has been deemed appropriate by society, _yi_ is the action that is indeed correct, while _ren_ deals with the relationship between the agent and object of the action**
- _**Li**_ **is the outward expression of Confucian ideals, while _ren_ is both the inward and outward expressions of those same ideals**

- **The Way (_dao_, 道) was Confucius term for his teachings; by extension its is the means of governance used by ancient kings, which he hoped to restore**
- **Individuals can make progress in the Way of self-cultivation; developing a sense of justice, loving treatment of parents, respect for elders, honesty with friends, etc. – becoming nobleman or gentleman**

- **The centre is deﬁned (in the Doctrine of the Mean, _Zhongyong_) as that which precedes humans’ beings pulled in situations by diﬀerent emotions; once these emotions have emerged, they need to be modulated by a centering process equivalent to what existed prior to their emergence – a modulation that is then termed harmony**
- **The implication of this argument is that the danger for humans is to be pulled by their emotions in diﬀerent situations, and humans must endlessly attempt to center and harmonize themselves**

- **The goal here is clearly one of self-cultivation: through cultivation, one becomes able, in any given situation, to be centered and harmonized**
- **“_Centering is the great base of all under Heaven; harmony is the achieved path of all under Heaven. With the utmost centering and harmonizing, Heaven and Earth are positioned thereby and the myriad things are nurtured thereby_.”**

## **(from _Zhongyong_)**

- **In any given situation, the gentleman is he who creates an order by forming the center: all the disparate phenomena thus come to be ordered by the center, which uniﬁes them around a common activity**
- **This would be true in everyday aﬀairs, dealing with human emotions, and equally true of the larger activities of humanity**

- **An example includes the ritual systems of centering that is developed in the sacriﬁce chapters of the _Liji_ (Book of Rites), in which, through the ritual extension of familial emotions, the world comes to be ordered like a genealogical family, with the ruler as the centre**

- **The _Daxue_ (Great Learning) works along comparable lines as well, here too, one sees an attempt to build a continuous line, starting from the person properly cultivated to the family to the larger realm and back again**
- **Only when such a line of continuity has been created that runs from the individual to the entire realm can true order be achieved**
- **Ritual works by taking disparate phenomena, linking them together and connecting them into chains of continuity**

- **Filial piety (_xiao_ 孝) is a virtue of respect for one’s father, elders, and ancestors**
- **For Confucius, filial piety was not blind loyalty to one’s parents; the norms of _ren_ and _yi_ were even more important; filial piety was a display of humanness (_ren_) which was ideally applied in one’s relations with all elders - a norm of intergenerational relations**
- **Filial piety was emphasized in Confucianism because devotion to one’s parents was often associated with devotion to the state**

- **The main bond in the family is between parent and child; Confucius described family unit in which sons lived together with their wives and parents**
- **Children should obey and honor their parents, even when they disagree with them, because parents raised them from birth – obligation that cannot be repaid**
- **During their lifetime children should obey their parents’ wishes, and after their deaths, children should continue to conduct family affairs as their parents did for three years**
- **Confucius advocated three-year mourning for one’s parents**

- **Confucius stressed the obligations of the individual because if each person could tap into his own humanity while adhering to the dictates of ritual within his family, the realm as a whole would be reformed and the Way restored**
- **One can influence the world simply by behaving as a gentleman at home, even when the world is chaotic**
- **If rulers developed benevolence, they would be able to check all chaotic forces in society**

- **Confucius sought to stop warfare by emphasizing ritual and man’s innate capacity for benevolence (highly idealistic view)**
- **He did not support punishments because he felt that the rule who relied on coercion could not command people’s respect**
- **Confucius looked down non-Chinese people (Yi and Di), but they, like common people, could respond to gentleman’s presence**

- **Mencius****, 孟子 Mengzi (372-289 BCE) was born in Zou, near Confucius’ hometown in state of Lu; he studied Confucian teachings as a young man**
- **Mencius advanced the ideas of Confucius’ Analects further**
- **Notwithstanding its early importance to Confucianism, the Mencius was not canonized as one of the Chinese Classics until over 1000 years later during the Song dynasty**

Mencius, Myths & Legends of China

By E.T.C. Werner, 1922

- **A central question for Mencius was whether men were endowed with good or bad natures at birth**
- **As the environment had altered the nature of Bull Mountain (the surroundings of Mencius), so too could it transform people**

- **Mencius believed that men were born good, and cited as proof the common human impulse to jump into well to save a drowning child**
- **People could be trusted to select a new ruler, and Mencius interpreted the concept of Mandate of Heaven to mean that the ruler can rule only with the help of his subjects**
- **This did not mean right of people to express their opinion; that was reserved only to king’s ministers**

- **Xunzi** **(310-210 BCE) thought that only assiduous education could counteract the original weakness of human nature; man was originally evil and can be improved by study**
- **In the two centuries between Confucius and his successors, the Zhou dynasty had become very weak, so neither Mencius nor Xunzi could seriously advocate their return to rule**
- **Both Mencius nor Xunzi advocated unification under competent ruler, whom they no longer expected to be descendent from Zhou**

- **Xunzi visited the kingdom of Qin before its conquest of Zhou and described the Legalist policies as harsh, predicting that the Qin could not last**
- **The ideal ruler for him was the king who could rule with the support of people**
- **A meritocracy would replace a system of privilege that had prevailed in the past**

# **Mohism**

- **Mohism – Mozi ( ca 480-400 BCE) was born in Tengzhou (Shandong province), state of Lu, when Confucius was dying, and his teaching was direct response to Confucius**
- **The text of Mozi was written centuries later by his disciples who had divided into different groups**
- **Mozi borrowed many terms from Confucius but not the distinction between gentleman and a common man**

- **As Mozi saw it, Confucius misunderstood _ren_: it meant doing good, not being good, and was about everyone, not just for your family**
- **Mozi argued that each individual had an obligation toward all the other people in human society, and he advocated “impartial caring” – _jian ai_ (often mistakenly translated as “universal love”) as a solution to society’s ills**
- **Individuals had to consider how their actions would affect everyone in society, not just the people they knew personally**

- **Mozi ridiculed Confucians for advocating elaborate funerals and lengthy mourning period and yet refusing to discuss spirits and afterlife:**
- **Mozi: “_To maintain that there are no spirits and to study sacrificial rites is like studying the ceremonies for treating guests without having any guests_.”**

- **Mozi is considered the first consequentialist in ethics: evaluation of moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the welfare of a state or society**
- **Basic goods were order (against war and violence), material wealth (like shelter, clothing), and increase in population**
- **Mozi: “_It is the business of the benevolent man to seek to promote what is beneficial to the world and to eliminate what is harmful, and to provide a model for the world. What benefits he will carry out; what does not benefit men he will leave alone_.”**

- **The Mohists believed that morality is based on “_promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven_.”**

- **In the centuries following Mozi’s death, his followers battled with Confucians over the contentious issues of music, funerals, and spirits, but they all agreed that the gentleman had to remain engaged in society if he was going to reform it**
- **Followers of another new school of thought argued instead that the best method of reforming society was to withdraw from society – Daoism**

# **Daoism**

- **Daoism: the _Daodejing_ - The Way and Integrity Classic is attributed as Laozi (Old Master)**
- **Laozi was a record keeper at the Zhou court by whose name the text is known in China**
- **The text took shape in the 3rd century BCE, but at that time there was no clearly identifiable group who could be called Daoists**

Laozi depicted as Daode Tianzun

(the Heavenly Lord of Dao and its Virtue)

- **Only in the 1st century BCE was the label Daoist attached to _Daodejing_**
- **At that time, Daoist referred to any teacher who practiced breathing techniques, meditation, austere eating regime in hope of extending his life span or even of gaining immortality**

- **Daoists disagreed with Confucius and Mozi; the Way of Universe is change: night into day, joy with sorrow, life into death**
- **Everything is connected to everything else; no one knows where the Way leads; we must become one with the Way, but cannot do so through fanatic activity**

- **The Dao is nameless, goes beyond distinctions, and transcends language**
- _**Daodejing**_ **begins as follows:**
	- “_The ways that can be walked of are not the eternal Way;_**

## _**The names that can be named are not the eternal name.**_

## _**It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang;**_

## _**The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand**_

## _**creatures, each after its kind**_**.”**

- **The _Daodejing_ advocates “female” (Yin) values, emphasizing the passive, solid, and quiescent qualities of nature (which is opposed to the active and energetic), and “having without possessing“**
- **Yin (“female”) and Yang (“male”) should be balanced, “Know masculinity, Maintain femininity, and be a ravine for all under heaven”**
- **The text praises self-gained knowledge with emphasis on that knowledge being gained with humility**

- _**Wuwei**_**, “effortless action” – spontaneity and noninterference, letting things follow their own natural course (often mistakenly translated as non-action)**
- **Water embodies the quality of _wuwei_, but so do too women and infants, who manage to get their desires even though they are weak**

- **He who governs, or the sage, should adopt the principle of allowing things to follow their natural course**
- **“Ruling a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish” (if one pays too much attention to the state or the small fish, it will be spoiled)**
- **Like the Analects, the Way of Integrity Classic looks to the past for model states**

- **The Daoist text targets Confucian values of sagehood, humanness, and righteousness, and Mozi’s emphasis on profit**
- _**Daodejing**_ **evokes the purity of those things that have not been touched by human hands – undyed silk and unhewn logs**
- _**Daodejing**_ **states: “_Abolish learning and you will be without worries_.”**

Confucius meets Laozi, Shih Kang, Yuan dynasty

- **Zhuangzi** **(linked to person who lived from 355 to 275 BC) is another Daoist text in the first century BC**
- **It focuses on individual, while Daodejing often addresses the ruler of a state**
- **Zhuangzi delighted in paradox and challenged the reader to abandon preconceived notions, often by making reader lough**

# **Legalism**

- **The Han Feizi (韓非子) is text (55 chapters, most of which date to 3rd cen. BCE) attributed to Master Han Fei: a selection of essays in the Legalist tradition on theories of state power, administration, diplomacy, war and economics**
- **Han Fei describes an interest-driven human nature together with the political methodologies to work with it in the interest of the state and Sovereign, namely, engaging in _wu-wei_ (passive observation)**

- **Crafting and use of Fa (law, measurement, statistic) to maintain leadership and manage human resources, its use to increase welfare, and its relation with justice**
- **Han binds programs to systematic reward and penalty (the Two Handles); the ruler minimizes his own input**
- **Like Shang Yang and other Fa philosophers, Han admonishes the ruler not to abandon Fa for any other means**

- **Han Feizi: _“If one has regulations based on objective standards and criteria and apply these to the mass of ministers, then that ruler cannot be duped by cunning fraudulence.”_**

- **According to the Legalists, _ren_, _jian ai_, and _dao_ all missed the point; trying to transcend reality was meaningless: godlike kings had yielded to managerial efficiency seeking ones, and the rest of us should get with the program**
- **For Lord Shang (fourth-century-BC prime minister of Qin), the goal was not humanness; it was “the enrichment of the state and the strengthening of military capacity” (_Fuguo Qiangbing)_**

- **Neither be good, nor do good, because “_A state that uses the wicked to govern the good always enjoys order and become strong_” (more Machiavellian than Machiavelli)**
- **If in enterprise you undertake what the enemy is ashamed to do, you have the advantage**
- **Waste no time on rituals, activism, and fatalism; instead draw up comprehensive law codes with brutal penalties (beheading, burial alive, hard labour) and impose them rigidly on everyone**

- **Legalists liked to say that like carpenter’s square laws force messy materials to conform**
- **Han Fei’s writings greatly influenced the First Emperor Qin, but they were officially vilified by the Han Dynasty**
- **Despite its outcast status throughout the history of imperial China, Han’s political theory continued to heavily influence every dynasty thereafter, and the Confucian ideal of a rule without laws was never again realized**

# **Art of War**

- **Sun Tzu – _The Art of War_ was attributed to military general (6th century BCE): Sun Wu was a military theorist from the end of the Spring and Autumn period who fled his home state of Qi to the southeastern kingdom of Wu, where he is credited to have made Wu’s armies powerful enough to challenge their western rivals in the state of Chu**
- **For almost 1,500 years it was the lead text in an anthology that would be formalised as the Seven Military Classics by Emperor Shenzong of Song in 1080**

Sun Tzu (544-496 BCE)

- **Each of 13 chapters was devoted to an aspect of warfare and how it applies to military strategy and tactics: planning, waging war, attack, positioning, maneuvering, movement of forces, configuration of terrain, intelligence**
- **“_Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle_.” (Last verse, Chapter 3)**

**Battle of Boju, 506 BCE, Sun Tzu was credited to have led Wu forces**

- **“_All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near_.” (Verse 18, Chapter 1)**

- **Chinese Axial thought ranged from mysticism to authoritarianism, and constantly evolving**
- **Xunzi for example combined Confucianism with Mozi’s ideas and Daoism and sought middle ground with Legalism (although he found the Legalist teachings in Qin as repellent)**
- **Plenty of Legalists welcomed Mozi’s work ethic and Daoists’ acceptance of things**

# **Chinese Medicine**

- **The Chinese Medicine is based on Daoist concepts; it can be considered an offspring of Daoism in its cosmological concept**
- **Therapeutic practices can be traced to Shang dynasty but there was no concept of “medicine” as distinct from other fields; their oracular inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells refer to illnesses that affected the Shang royal family: eye disorders, toothaches, bloated abdomen, etc.**
- **The doctrines of Chinese medicine are rooted in books such as the Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon (黄帝内经Huangdi Neijing) and the Treatise on Cold Damage**

- **Systematization of traditional medicine started during the Spring and Autumn period and matured during Western Han**
- **It continued to develop during Tang – Wang Bing, a Daoist monk , and other authors complied various texts, including Inner Cannon (the contemporary version of the Inner Cannon is largely based on Wang Bin’s collection)**

- **Huangdi Neijing’s two main texts: the first text, the Suwen, also known as Basic Questions, covers the theoretical foundation of Chinese Medicine and its diagnostic methods**
- **The second and generally less referred-to text, the Lingshu (Spiritual Pivot), discusses acupuncture therapy in detail**
- **Song dynasty sponsored empire-wide compilation of herbal recipes**
- **Education in medicine was through apprenticeship; often those who failed at exams became medical practitioners**

- **The medicine is based on cosmological notions such as yin–yang and the five phases (elements): wood, fire, earth, metal, water**
- **One-qi theory – formless beginning of the world; qi becomes yin and yang; and from yin and yang – emerge five phases (stages representing dynamism of yin and yang); from the five phases come ten thousand things or the material world**
- **To follow nature’s law – fundamental principle: the body and cosmos are linked through cyclical dynamism of yin and yang (the five phases are material manifestation of this dynamism)**
