Here are point-form notes on the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), suitable for copying and pasting, drawn directly from the provided sources:

**I. Foundation and Early Rulers (Western Han: 202 BC – 9 AD)**

- The **Han Dynasty** spanned from **202 BC to 220 AD**.
- The dynasty followed the Qin dynasty.
- **Qin Collapse:**
    - **Qin Er Shi** executed officials and imperial princes, killed messengers who brought bad news, launched extravagant projects, enlarged the army, and increased taxes.
    - In **207 BCE**, people revolted, killing officials and raising armies.
    - **Zhao Gao** forced the second Qin emperor to commit suicide and became chancellor himself in 208 BCE after ordering the killing of Legalist chancellor **Li Si**.
- **Rise of Han:**
    - China fissured into **18 fengjian states** (Eighteen Kingdoms) created by military leader **Xiang Yu** in **206 BCE**.
    - Two former rebel leaders, **Xiang Yu of Chu** and **Liu Bang of Han**, fought to become the hegemon, with the kingdoms aligning with one or the other.
    - **Liu Bang** defeated Xiang Yu at the **Battle of Gaixia (202 BC)**, in modern-day Anhui.
    - Liu Bang assumed the title **"emperor" (_huangdi_)** and is known posthumously as **Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC)**.

**II. Emperor Gaozu's Administration and Policies**

- Liu Bang attacked the Qin for its brutal laws but **retained most of its laws**.
- Han rulers modified but did not eliminate the Qin legal system; they allowed the guilty to **pay fines** instead of enduring stipulated punishments, and the most gruesome punishments were cancelled.
- **Departure from Qin policy (Nobility):**
    - The Qin required all nobility of conquered kingdoms to reside in the capital.
    - The Han founder created a **new nobility**.
    - Emperor Gao gave nine of his brothers and sons the title of **king and lands**.
    - He named **150 trusted followers** to the rank of **marquis**.
    - Only about **one-third of the empire** (the western part, including the capital **Changan/Xian**) remained under **direct imperial administration**.
    - Coastal areas and much of the south were populated mostly by **non-Chinese peoples**.
- **Government Structure:** Had three major divisions at central and local levels (like Qin): collection of taxes, army, and government officials.
- **Local Administration:** Territory was divided into **100 commandaries and 1500 counties**. Local administration registered the population, collected taxes, maintained waterways, and administered justice.
- **Military Conflicts:**
    - Emperor Gao had to suppress rebellions from the nobility and fight the northern **Xiongnu** people.
    - A war campaign in the north in **201 BCE** resulted in the first Han emperor being **trapped by the Xiongnu in a walled city for seven days**.
    - Hostilities ended in **198 BCE**; the Chinese recognized the Xiongnu as a **brother or peer state**, promised **gifts**, and sent a **Chinese princess** to marry the Xiongnu leader.

**III. Succession and Emperor Wu (140–87 BCE)**

- Liu Bang died in 195 BCE; his 15-year-old son **Huidi** succeeded him.
- After Huidi died, **Empress Lu (188–180 BCE)** ruled behind infants on the throne.
- **Emperor Wu (140–87 BCE):**
    - Established **Confucian institutions** and precedents for all successors.
    - Endorsed **Confucianism as the national philosophy**, replacing the previously esteemed libertarian **Daoist ideals**.
    - Eliminated checks on imperial power and expanded territory.
    - Fought the **southern Yue** and the **Xiongnu in the north**.
    - His campaigns resulted in a **drain of resources**, and his successors struggled to accumulate sufficient revenue.
    - Limited the power of regional rulers empowered by the Han founder.
    - Evicted noblemen back to their own fiefdoms so they could no longer live off government spending.
    - Required that when a ruler died (**after 127 BCE**), his lands were divided among **all sons**, not just the oldest.
    - Required these noble families to **move close to the capital** (similar to Qin policy).
    - Refused to appoint sons of powerful families to high positions; instead, he recruited and promoted **talented commoners** to government positions.
- **Confucian Recruitment/Education:**
    - Wu named five scholars as **Erudite Scholars** specializing in Confucian classics, a step toward forming the Confucian canon.
    - Named 50 students to study with the scholars and created an **imperial academy**.
    - Established **schools in each locality**; students could join local government, attend the imperial academy, or be appointed to the central bureaucracy.
    - The Han dynasty continued to recruit officials by **recommendation**, requiring them to take **examinations** upon arrival in the capital for appropriate placement.

**IV. Economy and Social Change**

- Empress Lu initially set the land tax at **6.67% of produce** and later lowered it further.
- In **119 BCE**, the government created **monopolies** to raise revenues, covering:
    - Iron and salt.
    - Production of copper and bronze (right to mint currency).
    - Production of wine (fermented beverage from grain).
- There was an **expansion of trade**, including with the Xiongnu people.
- Captured people from neighboring lands were **enslaved**; some slaves could buy their way out of slavery.
- To fight the Xiongnu, Han developed **huge cavalry squadrons**, increasingly recruited from nomads themselves, which militarized the frontier and demilitarized the interior.
- As the state’s monopoly on force weakened, **aristocrats bullied local peasants**, expanding their farms into **huge estates** run as private fiefdoms.
- Consequently, **less of the surplus was sent to the capital Changan as tax**, being diverted to local masters instead.
- The economy continued to grow in the 1st and 2nd centuries, but the central government struggled to access that growth.
- **Social Hierarchy (Later Han):** Landed scholarly families were at the top, peasants and artisans ranked second and third, and merchants were at the bottom. There was movement among different social groups.

**V. Decline and Fall (Later Han/Eastern Han: 25–220 AD)**

- **Wang Mang Interregnum (7–23 CE):**
    - Regent **Wang Ming (7–23 CE)** attempted to curtail the power of large estate owners by limiting the size of estates.
    - He **nationalized all land**, **abolished slavery and serfdom**, and declared that only the state could own gold.
    - This centralization collapsed almost immediately, convulsed by peasant uprisings.
- **Restoration (Eastern Han):**
    - Floods in the Yellow River basin prompted further peasant rebellions.
    - A **coalition of landowning families** suppressed the rebellion and defeated imperial forces.
    - They placed a distant heir, **Gwangwu (25–57)**, of the Han founder in power.
    - Gwangwu, from a **propertied family** (not the old court elite), moved the capital from **Changan to Luoyang** (serving as capital until 190).
    - To restore authority, Gwangwu had to work closely with his **fellow magnates**.
    - This led to a "golden age for landowners" where powerful families enlarged their estates and placed their sons in office. **Eunuchs** also began to play a more important role.
    - Court intrigue marked the last two centuries of the Han dynasty.
    - Consort families often chose child emperors, with their daughters ruling as **dowager empresses**.
- **Imperial Collapse and Fragmentation:**
    - The elite began rolling back the state, and the army steadily disintegrated; the great cavalry army (with Xiongnu no longer a major threat) was left to extort and plunder from peasants.
    - The empire was smaller, and tax receipts dwindled, yet landowners’ estates were highly productive, and imperial tax collectors left them alone.
    - By 150 CE, the southern **Xiongnu** and the **Qiang** (who took large swathes of western provinces) were largely beyond Luoyang's control.
    - In **145**, three separate rebellions demanded a new dynasty.
    - Emperor Huan, chosen by the consort Liang family in 146, staged a coup against them in 159 using eunuchs. Huan then turned to **Daoists** for support.
- **Religious Uprisings:**
    - Daoist rebels claimed to have seen **Laozi**, foretelling a new utopian era.
    - One Daoist group was the **Celestial Masters or Five Peck of Rice**, active in Sichuan, credited with founding the Way of the Celestial Masters around 142 AD.
    - The **Yellow Turbans** (rebelled in **184** between the Yellow and Huai rivers) shared practices with the Celestial Masters, viewing illness as a sign of wrongdoing and encouraging confession to sins. They claimed to inaugurate the **Era of Great Peace (_taiping_)**.
    - The Yellow Turbans rebellion was suppressed by **Cao Cao’s forces** by the end of 184, leaving the Five Pecks as the only surviving Daoist group.
- **Final End:**
    - Following the death of Emperor Ling (168–189 AD), military officers massacred palace eunuchs, allowing **aristocrats and military governors to become warlords and divide the empire**.
    - In **192**, **Cao Cao (155–220)** became regent but gained control of only one-third of Han territory.
    - In **220**, **Cao Pi**, King of Wei, usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ending the Han Dynasty.
    - This was followed by **three centuries of disunity**, often called the **Six Dynasties (220–589)**.
