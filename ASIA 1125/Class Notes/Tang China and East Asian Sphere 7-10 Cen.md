**Tang Dynasty East Asia Sphere (7th–10th Centuries)**

**Founding of the Tang Dynasty**

• Rebellions broke out and the Sui emperor was killed following the failed military campaign against Koguryo.

• In 618, rebel general **Li Yuan declared the founding of the new dynasty Tang and became Emperor Gaozu (r. 618–624)**.

• Like the Sui emperors, he belonged to the north Chinese aristocracy and was of mixed Chinese and Turkic ancestry.

• The Tang secured control of the empire by 624.

• The Tang ruled China for nearly three centuries (618–907), though its power was severely weakened after 755 due to the An Lushan rebellion.

**The Golden Age and Emperor Taizong (626–649)**

• The Tang enjoys a reputation as China’s most glorious dynasty, partly due to the enormous territory it conquered and ruled.

• Tang domination stretched far into Central Asia, including much of the modern Xinjiang.

• The dynasty is famous for the many great poets, essayists, and artists who lived at that time.

• The machinery of government functioned efficiently, standing as a high point in Chinese history, at least until 755.

• Problems of political succession plagued the Tang dynasty from its founding.

• Two sons contended for power; one, **Li Shimin (r. 626–649)**, killed the heir apparent and another brother, forced his father to step down, and ruled as **Emperor Taizong**.

• Emperor Taizong enthusiastically patronized Buddhism, despite initially banning all foreign travel, which forced the famous monk Xuanzang to escape from China.

• When **Xuanzang** returned from his sixteen-year journey to Central Asia and India, the emperor welcomed him and gave him presents.

• Xuanzang was the most famous Buddhist pilgrim and an accomplished translator of texts from Sanskrit to Chinese.

• His journey inspired the novel _Journey to the West_, written by Wu Chengen during the Ming dynasty.

**The Tang Code and Governance**

• Emperor Taizong presided over the issuing of a new legal code, one of the great projects of the Tang.

• Subsequent Chinese dynasties, as well as China’s neighbors (Koreans, Japanese, and Vietnamese), adopted the **Tang Code** in part or in full.

• The Code aimed at automatic administration of justice, granting local magistrates no discretion in applying the law.

• The magistrate’s job was generally to decide which article applied and then sentence the culprit.

• Higher officials reviewed punishments, and the emperor had to approve all cases involving the death penalty.

• Magistrates could make decisions by analogy when an offense did not fall under a specific provision, providing the law with a generalized, adaptable, and flexible nature.

• The Code divided society into three groups: **privileged** (imperial relatives and high officials), **commoners**, and **inferior people** (personal retainers and slaves).

• Penalties were calibrated based on the age, sex, and mental/physical condition of the offender.

• The Code reflected Legalist thinking but espoused Confucian values, evidenced by the much heavier penalty for killing one’s father than for killing a stranger.

• A son could be punished for hitting his father, but a father was free to hit his son; the same imbalance applied to husbands and wives.

**The Reign of Empress Wu Zetian (690–705)**

• After Taizong died in 649, his low-ranking concubine **Wu Zhao** (later Wu Zetian) secured her position, eventually dealing with the empress and another concubine.

• Tang Gaozong (r. 649–683) became a shadow of his wife, Empress Wu.

• She became the _de facto_ ruler in 660 after the emperor suffered a paralyzing stroke.

• She crowned herself empress in 690, assuming the title **Sheng Shen Huangdi** (Sacred and Divine Empress Regnant).

• **Wu Zetian** was the only woman to found her own dynasty, the **Zhou**.

• She challenged the Confucian ideal of women obeying their husbands; traditional historians viewed her rule as a violation of natural order.

• Her greatest innovation was using a particular form of **Buddhism to legitimate her rule**.

• She commissioned the carving of the 17-meter-high **Absolute Cosmic Vairocana Buddha** in the Ancestor Worshiping Cave at Longmen.

• In 694, she claimed to be the **Maitreya Buddha** who presides over the future paradise.

• Wu allowed commoners into the administration because she could not fully rely on the aristocratic establishment.

• She encouraged women to be entrepreneurs and allowed them to divorce and remarry freely.

• She appointed her female personal secretary, **Shangguan Waner**, who became _de facto_ prime minister.

• She was deposed in a palace coup in **705**, and the Tang dynasty was restored.

**Emperor Xuanzong (712–756) and Changan**

• After seven years of court infighting following Wu Zetian’s deposition, **Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–756)** took power and is considered one of China’s most talented emperors.

• He brought efficiency to government institutions and oversaw a large territory.

• The Tang government used **Six Ministries (the Six Boards): Revenue, Civil Appointments, Rites, Works, Punishments, and War**, which remained in use until the 20th century.

• **Changan** reached a population of **one million people**, making it one of the largest cities in the world.

• It was a cosmopolitan urban center with significant foreign populations.

• Changan was laid out on a north-south axis in a grid pattern, divided into **108 wards** and featuring two large marketplaces (east and west).

• The layout of Changan influenced city planning in several other Asian capitals, including Heijokyo (Nara), Kyoto, Kyungju, and Sanggyong.

• The outer walls of the city formed a perfect rectangle, 9.5 km long by 8.4 km north-south (totaling 80 sq. km).

• A nightly curfew was strictly enforced throughout the city.

• Because of a chronic shortage of bronze coins, **bolts of silk served as the main currency**, supplemented by silver coins brought from Iran.

• Government officials were suspicious of merchants (viewing them as potential spies) and maintained strict surveillance, checking travel documents at every checkpoint.

• As of 722, Changan had ninety-one Buddhist temples. Monks provided services like dispensaries, pawnshops, hostels, and public baths, and the city hired Buddhists to run hospitals.

**The Examination System and Land Policy**

• The government used exams primarily to recruit men of good character, although most who passed came from the existing scholar-official class.

• **Poetry** was a regular part of the advanced degree; examiners prioritized mastery of the form (indicating high background) over originality.

• Before 755, merchants were banned from civil service exams.

• The **household registration system** was crucial for governance, used to count household members, determine eligibility for military and labor service, and divide the population into nine grades for taxation.

• The registers were also the basis for the **equal-field system** of land redistribution.

• Land was divided into two categories: **personal share** (granted to each married couple, reverting to the state upon death) and **perpetual holdings** (for long-term investment like mulberry orchards).

• Households paid taxes in grain and cloth and performed labor service in return for the land.

• The system was plagued by the falsification of registers and chronic shortfalls in revenue; many people, including the imperial family and clergy, were exempt from taxes.

**The An Lushan Rebellion (755–763)**

• In **755, General An Lushan declared himself emperor** in Northern China, establishing the rival Yan Dynasty.

• An Lushan was part-Turkish and part-Sogdian.

• Emperor Xuanzong's consort, **Yang Guefei**, had adopted An Lushan as her honorary son.

• After An rebelled and took Luoyang, Emperor Xuanzong was forced to flee to Sichuan.

• On the journey, imperial troops mutinied and forced the emperor to kill Consort Yang, whom they blamed for their predicament.

• The new Tang emperor Suzong (r. 756–762) regained Changan with the help of **Uighur mercenaries**.

• The rebellion ended in **763**.

• The peace was immediately shattered when **Tibetan troops entered Changan** in 763, pillaged the city, and continued to attack the capital every autumn for twenty years.

**Post-Rebellion Decline and Reform**

• The rebellion destroyed cities and wrecked the equal-field system.

• The number of registered households dropped from 9 million in 755 to 2 million in 760 because the household registration system could not be enforced.

• The empire's tax base fell to less than one-third of what it had been.

• Personal share land, after the system's collapse, became entirely **heritable**.

• The emperor was forced to share power with **military governors** who commanded their own armies and funded them using local tax revenues.

• The court named four former rebel generals to serve as military governors of Hebei in 763.

• When military governors seceded by refusing to pay taxes (starting with Hebei and Henan), the center lost over one-quarter of the empire’s population and revenue.

• The desperate court appointed special commissioners to raise revenue through means like selling offices and taxing trade.

• The state realized that the **salt monopoly** could produce the highest revenue; in 799, it generated half the central government’s revenue.

• The defunct equal-field tax was replaced by the **two-tax system**—a twice-yearly collection of quotas in summer and autumn, calculated in money (bronze coins or silver specie).

• The ban on merchants sitting for the exams was eased because officials needed their expertise to raise revenue.

**Eunuchs and the Anti-Buddhist Campaign**

• The changes after 755 empowered the **eunuchs**.

• Most Tang eunuchs came from poor indigenous districts in the south (Fujian was called "eunuch factory").

• After the An Lushan rebellion, eunuchs gradually gained control of the emperor’s personal army, which was the only force not commanded by military governors.

• The **Eunuch’s Palace Council**, formed in the 9th century, advised the emperor and posed a threat to court ministers.

• Many officials blamed the chronic deflation and coin shortage on the excessive use of copper to make Buddhist statues.

• Following advice from Daoist adherents, the emperor issued edicts to reduce the wealth and power of Buddhist monasteries.

• In 842, the emperor ordered monks to return to lay life or begin paying taxes.

• In **845, the emperor ordered all tax-exempt Buddhist monasteries to close** (allowing only a few to remain in Changan, Louyang, and other localities).

**Final Collapse of the Tang**

• A series of uprisings began in **874**.

• The rebels’ goals were to loot cities and avoid paying taxes.

• **Huang Chao**, a failed examination candidate, emerged as the rebels’ leader.

• In 880, Huang took Changan and declared himself the founder of a new dynasty (Qi), but the rebels were defeated by Shatuo Turks and subsequently ravaged the city.

• The emperor was held prisoner by eunuchs and military governors after 885.

• In **904**, the regional commander **Zhu Wen** (a former rebel) captured the emperor, executed the entire imperial entourage, and dismantled the palaces.

• In **907, Zhu killed the last Tang boy-emperor** and founded the Liang dynasty.

• The period from **907–960** is known as the **Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms**, characterized by a succession of regional kingdoms.

• General **Zhao Kyungyin founded the Song dynasty in 960**.
