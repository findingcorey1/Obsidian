* Zhou introduced the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven ( 天命 ), which justified the overthrow of the Shang; it established the idea that rulers ruled by divine approval, but they could lose legitimacy if they governed unjustly
* Feudal System (Fengjian 分封制 ), establishing a decentralized feudal order by granting land and authority to relatives and loyal followers; the system helped them control vast territories but eventually weakened central power
* Schools of thought in late Zhou (Eastern Zhou, especially the spring and  autumn and warring state periods): Confucianism, Daoism, Legalism, and Mohism all emerged in this area
* Technological and economic developments: iron tools and weapons spread during the Eastern Zhou, increasing agricultural productivity and military power; coinage appeared, trade expanded, and urban centers grew; advances in military organization (crossbow, cavalry, large armies) reshaped warfare
* Political fragmentation and: as Zhou declined regional states gained autonomy and competed for dominance; the Warring States period fostered bureaucratic reforms, merit-based appointments, and codified laws - setting foundations for the centralized Qin empire
* Cultural legacy: rituals, music, and ancestor worship were codified and transmitted through classics like the Book of Songs (Shijing) and Book of Documents (Shujing)
* Zhou ritual order became the cultural model for later dynasties; Zhou dynasty gave China enduring symbols of legitimacy, hierarchy, and cultural unity, even as real political power declined

* Zhou dynasty introduced the concept of Mandate of Heaven to legitimize its rulership, and explained and justified the demise of Xia and Shang
* Set an example for all succeeding dynasties, who would claim they had defeated the previous dynasty not because of superior strength but because their supreme deity, Heaven, had willed them to do so
* For Zhou people Heaven represented supreme divine force (what Di was for Shang) – similar to the concept of cosmos
* Later thinkers interpreted the Mandate of Heaven as a check on evil rulers
* If an emperor could not govern the Heaven would show that it had withdrawn support by sending disasters, unusual celestial events or man-made disasters like peasant rebellions (some philosophers argued that people had the right to rebel against a bad king)
* Zhou recognized only patrilineal primogeniture as legal
* The decentralized system became strained as the familial relationships between the Zhou kings and the regional dynasties thinned over the generations
* Peripheral territories developed local power and prestige rivalling that of the Zhou

* Continuities between Shang and Zhou: Zhou kings consulted oracle bones and at the same time they consulted the hexagrams (six broken or unbroken lines, king Wen sequence of sixty-four divination figures) indicated by the yarrow stalks
* Zhou kings’ subjects used oracles to determine whether they should marry or what the ancestors were saying during their ceremonies
* Both Shang and Zhou people used their literacy to record campaigns against their voiceless neighbors, whom they pushed further away from the heartland of the Yellow River valley
* Shang and Zhou were soft states with incipient form of taxation and uncertain borders; gifts from subjects to ruler provided the major source of royal income, and in exchange the kings granted their subjects land, ritual privileges to use certain tools
* The kings could call on their subordinates to provide them with troops, while the subordinates could easily defect to the side of a ruler they thought more powerful
* The Book of Songs (305 works dating from 11th to 7th centuries BCE) describes the obligations of farm laborers to their lord, whom they gave agricultural produce, hunted animals and cloth
* Division of labor characterized the estate: men farmed and hunted, while women gathered mulberry leaves, spun thread, dyed textiles, and made clothing
* Inscriptions of Zhou bells chime the prayers of the living for their sons and grandsons – not for their daughters and granddaughters (the precedence of sons over daughters is visible in early oracle bones and extends even to today's china)
* Further weakening of royal authority
* In 770 BCE, two dependent states made an alliance with some tribal peoples to overthrow the Zhou king
* Local nobles declared Marquis of Shen’s grandson King Ping – beginning of Eastern Zhou (770 BCE); coincided with raid of Haojing (West Zhou capital) by Scythian tribes
* The defeated Zhou shifted the capital east, near Louyang on Yellow River, where the king rules as s symbolic head over competing regional leaders, who commanded armies
