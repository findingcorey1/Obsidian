* Zhou introduced the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven ( 天命 ), which justified the overthrow of the Shang; it established the idea that rulers ruled by divine approval, but they could lose legitimacy if they governed unjustly
* Feudal System (Fengjian 分封制 ), establishing a decentralized feudal order by granting land and authority to relatives and loyal followers; the system helped them control vast territories but eventually weakened central power
* Schools of thought in late Zhou (Eastern Zhou, especially the spring and  autumn and warring state periods): Confucianism, Daoism, Legalism, and Mohism all emerged in this area
* Technological and economic developments: iron tools and weapons spread during the Eastern Zhou, increasing agricultural productivity and military power; coinage appeared, trade expanded, and urban centers grew; advances in military organization (crossbow, cavalry, large armies) reshaped warfare
* Political fragmentation and: as Zhou declined regional states gained autonomy and competed for dominance; the Warring States period fostered bureaucratic reforms, merit-based appointments, and codified laws - setting foundations for the centralized Qin empire
* Cultural legacy: rituals, music, and ancestor worship were codified and transmitted through classics like the Book of Songs (Shijing) and Book of Documents (Shujing)
* Zhou ritual order became the cultural model for later dynasties; Zhou dynasty gave China enduring symbols of legitimacy, hierarchy, and cultural unity, even as real political power declined

* Zhou dynasty introduced the concept of Mandate of Heaven to legitimize its rulership, and explained and justified the demise of Xia and Shang
* Set an example for all succeeding dynasties, who would claim they had defeated the previous dynasty not because of superior strength but because their supreme deity, Heaven, had willed them to do so
* For Zhou people Heaven represented supreme divine force (what Di was for Shang) – similar to the concept of cosmos
* Later thinkers interpreted the Mandate of Heaven as a check on evil rulers
* If an emperor could not govern the Heaven would show that it had withdrawn support by sending disasters, unusual celestial events or man-made disasters like peasant rebellions (some philosophers argued that people had the right to rebel against a bad king)
* Zhou recognized only patrilineal primogeniture as legal
* The decentralized system became strained as the familial relationships between the Zhou kings and the regional dynasties thinned over the generations
* Peripheral territories developed local power and prestige rivalling that of the Zhou

* Continuities between Shang and Zhou: Zhou kings consulted oracle bones and at the same time they consulted the hexagrams (six broken or unbroken lines, king Wen sequence of sixty-four divination figures) indicated by the yarrow stalks
* Zhou kings’ subjects used oracles to determine whether they should marry or what the ancestors were saying during their ceremonies
