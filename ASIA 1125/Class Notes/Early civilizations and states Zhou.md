* Zhou introduced the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven ( 天命 ), which justified the overthrow of the Shang; it established the idea that rulers ruled by divine approval, but they could lose legitimacy if they governed unjustly
* Feudal System (Fengjian 分封制 ), establishing a decentralized feudal order by granting land and authority to relatives and loyal followers; the system helped them control vast territories but eventually weakened central power
* Schools of thought in late Zhou (Eastern Zhou, especially the spring and  autumn and warring state periods): Confucianism, Daoism, Legalism, and Mohism all emerged in this area
* Technological and economic developments: iron tools and weapons spread during the Eastern Zhou, increasing agricultural productivity and military power; coinage appeared, trade expanded, and urban centers grew; advances in military organization (crossbow, cavalry, large armies) reshaped warfare
* Political fragmentation and: as Zhou declined regional states gained autonomy and competed for dominance; the Warring States period fostered bureaucratic reforms, merit-based appointments, and codified laws - setting foundations for the centralized Qin empire
* Cultural legacy: rituals, music, and ancestor worship were codified and transmitted through classics like the Book of Songs (Shijing) and Book of Documents (Shujing)
* Zhou ritual order became the cultural model for later dynasties; Zhou dynasty gave China enduring symbols of legitimacy, hierarchy, and cultural unity, even as real political power declined

* Zhou dynasty introduced the concept of Mandate of Heaven to legitimize its rulership, and explained and justified the demise of Xia and Shang
* Set an example for all succeeding dynasties, who would claim they had defeated the previous dynasty not because of superior strength but because their supreme deity, Heaven, had willed them to do so
* For Zhou people Heaven represented supreme divine force (what Di was for Shang) – similar to the concept of cosmos
* Later thinkers interpreted the Mandate of Heaven as a check on evil rulers
* If an emperor could not govern the Heaven would show that it had withdrawn support by sending disasters, unusual celestial events or man-made disasters like peasant rebellions (some philosophers argued that people had the right to rebel against a bad king)
* Zhou recognized only patrilineal primogeniture as legal
* The decentralized system became strained as the familial relationships between the Zhou kings and the regional dynasties thinned over the generations
* Peripheral territories developed local power and prestige rivalling that of the Zhou
	* ![[Pasted image 20251014165207.png]]
* Continuities between Shang and Zhou: Zhou kings consulted oracle bones and at the same time they consulted the hexagrams (six broken or unbroken lines, king Wen sequence of sixty-four divination figures) indicated by the yarrow stalks
* Zhou kings’ subjects used oracles to determine whether they should marry or what the ancestors were saying during their ceremonies
* Both Shang and Zhou people used their literacy to record campaigns against their voiceless neighbors, whom they pushed further away from the heartland of the Yellow River valley
* Shang and Zhou were soft states with incipient form of taxation and uncertain borders; gifts from subjects to ruler provided the major source of royal income, and in exchange the kings granted their subjects land, ritual privileges to use certain tools
* The kings could call on their subordinates to provide them with troops, while the subordinates could easily defect to the side of a ruler they thought more powerful
* The Book of Songs (305 works dating from 11th to 7th centuries BCE) describes the obligations of farm laborers to their lord, whom they gave agricultural produce, hunted animals and cloth
* Division of labor characterized the estate: men farmed and hunted, while women gathered mulberry leaves, spun thread, dyed textiles, and made clothing
* Inscriptions of Zhou bells chime the prayers of the living for their sons and grandsons – not for their daughters and granddaughters (the precedence of sons over daughters is visible in early oracle bones and extends even to today's china)
* Further weakening of royal authority
* In 770 BCE, two dependent states made an alliance with some tribal peoples to overthrow the Zhou king
* Local nobles declared Marquis of Shen’s grandson King Ping – beginning of Eastern Zhou (770 BCE); coincided with raid of Haojing (West Zhou capital) by Scythian tribes
* The defeated Zhou shifted the capital east, near Louyang on Yellow River, where the king rules as s symbolic head over competing regional leaders, who commanded armies superior to his
* The historians divide six centuries of warfare (from 770 to 221 BCE) comprising the Eastern Zhou period into two halves: the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 BCE), followed by partition of Jin and the Warring States period (481-221 BCE)
* From time to time, the Zhou king recognized one ruler as more powerful than the others, but no polity succeeded in conquering all its neighbors
* Some of the more than one hundred polities were large, others consisted of only a walled town or two
* Eventually some seven states became predominant; the “[[central states]]” (zhongguo) were all located around Yellow River; Yangtze River marked the southern frontier of the Chinese central area
	* ![[Pasted image 20251014170940.png]]
* The Zhou people classified non-Chinese neighbors in four groups: the Rong and Di tribes to the west and north, the Yi to the east, and the Man to the south; many of these groups also lived in mountain pockets within the central states
* For all mixing and interaction the Zhou reluctantly acknowledged their debt to the alien people, from whom they learned to fight with cavalry rather than with chariots
* As certain polities conquered more territory, the general awareness of the cultural differences between the Chinese and the non-Chinese intensified 
* The Commentary of Mr. Zuo (4th century BCE) explains events during the Spring and Autumn period: over 500 battles among polities and over 100 civil wars within polities in a span of 259 years – between 722 and 463 BCE
* Duke Wen of Jin – Double Ears (636-628 BCE) was so successful ruler that the Zhou king awarded him the title Duke Wen after his death
* Duke Wen ruled Jin realm, originally territory of younger brother of a Zhou king (present Shanxi province), capital Hoama
* Wen was born to non-Chinese (Rong) mother, and fought with his half-brothers to regain control of his father’s realm; he tripled the army after he became ruler of Jin
* After Wen’s defeat of Chu forces rulers of several small polities acknowledged the dominant position of Jin by taking an oath before gods, called blood covenants, which bound the participants to adhere to the agreements Duke
* Duke Wen of Jin, by Li Tang (1140)
