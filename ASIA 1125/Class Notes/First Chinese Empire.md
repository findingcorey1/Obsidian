* Over the Warring States period, many of the seven states underwent bureaucratic and military reforms in order to mobilise resources; intensification of warfare over the period, but also economic and cultural developments on a large scale
* In 221 BCЕ, the Warring States period came to and end, as the kingdom of Qin defeated all its competitor kingdoms and unified the empire
* King Zheng of Qin crowned himself China first emperor (China derives from the name of the uniting dynasty Qin via Latin and Sanskrit)
* Bureaucracy provided new form of government which was far more efficient than the aristocratic rule of the Warring States period
* The Qin ruler used the bureaucracy to build a war machine
* The state created by Qin survived for only fourteen years, and its successor, the Han dynasty, ruled China for the next four centuries 
* The architect of Qin success was Shang Yang, a powerful prime minister, who initiated series of reforms to build a strong legalist state in 359 BC
* The Legalists (fajia “law experts”) abolished intermediaries between cultivators and the state, extending earlier attempts of Warring States to establish direct link between ruler and subjects
* Registers listed members of groups of five and ten who bore mutual responsibility should one commit a crime
* Minister Shang divided Qin society into interlocking units, (smallest were five and ten households); these units formed larger units of county (xian) which provided local government’s services
* County officials organized the army, carried out public works, collected taxes, and administered justice; the state reached from the county and reached down to the lowest unit of land (individual’s field)

* Minister Shang established private ownership of land; the land continued to be viewed of ruler’s property, but the link between the land ownership and military service provided people with stronger claim to the land than when they worked in estates in earlier times
* Militarization: once a man reached an age of fifteen or seventeen (and height of 1.5 meters) he was obliged to perform military service, fulfill labour obligations, and pay taxes on his land (the Legalists did not distinguish army from society, so they expected all men to serve in army)
* The Qin first implemented these measures within their own borders, but in 316 BCЕ Qin state began a series of conquests that accelerated under the leadership of young King Zheng (259-210 BCЕ)
* King Zheng came to the throne in 246 at age of thirteen, and when he turned twenty-one, he took control of power and led the kingdom through fifteen years of all-out war that culminated with unification of China in 221 BCЕ 
* Of the Seven Warring States, Qin eventually emerged the strongest and annexed the other six states
* Han was the first to fall, in 230 BCЕ, while Qi was the last to surrender in 221 BCЕ
* King Zheng of Qin took the title Shi Huangdi ( 秦始皇帝 , “First August Emperor of Qin), a new title composed by combining various honorifics previously used individually for various human or divine rulers
* Huang” ( 皇 ) - august / exalted; 皇 as 白 + 王 (linked to mythic “Three Sovereigns,” especially the Yellow Emperor ( 黃帝 ); Huang 黃 as 艹 + 田 + 八 + 一 
* “Di” 帝 - emperor (divine, taken from the “Five Emperors” of legend)

* Qin Shi Huang, king of Qin (247-220 BCЕ)  
* Emperor (220-210)
* Qin ruler required all six defeated kings move to his capital with the noble families of their kingdoms 
* He took the title Shi Huangdi (First Augustus Emperor); Di (emperor, highest deity); fusing god-like king with great conqueror made self-divinization plausible 
* In an effort to consolidate power, Qin emperor toured the empire five times between 220 and 210 BCЕ, to show himself to people and make offerings to the spirits 
* Along Yang Shang’s teaching, Qin emphasized farming the mainstay of the economy
* The emperor unified all measures and imposed standard currency on the realm – a circular coin with a square in the middle (replacing monies of Warring States in the forms of knives, shovels, and shells); the coins could be threaded together to form strings
* In addition to unified units for length and volume, the new dynasty standardized the gauge for vehicles so that roads should be with uniform width 
* The Qin dynasty mobilized the population for massive projects: by 210 BCE, 6,800 km of roads were built; 300,000 people built walls (earth) in the north; construction of irrigation canals 
* Qin divided the territory into regional units – commanderies; the initial 36 were increased to 42
* ![[Pasted image 20251014200848.png]]
* The whole of Qin was divided into administrative units: first commanderies, then counties (Xian), townships (Xiang) and hundred-family units (Li), which roughly corresponds to the modern-day subdistricts and communities
* Appointments were subsequently based on merit instead of hereditary rights – early signs of meritocratic system
* Standardization of the script, the Small Seal replaced the Large Seal script (used by Warring States with reginal variations), and the Qin officials discouraged the use of different variants for the same character
* The rulers ensured linguistic unity even when the empire was no longer unified; the Small Seal script was replaced by the succeeding dynasty, clerical script, with characters used today)
