* King Zheng of Qin crowned himself China first emperor (China derives from the name of the uniting dynasty Qin via Latin and Sanskrit)
* Bureaucracy provided new form of government which was far more efficient than the aristocratic rule of the Warring States period
* The Qin ruler used the bureaucracy to build a war machine
* The state created by Qin survived for only fourteen years, and its successor, the Han dynasty, ruled China for the next four centuries 
* The architect of Qin success was Shang Yang, a powerful prime minister, who initiated series of reforms to build a strong legalist state in 359 BC
* The Legalists (fajia “law experts”) abolished intermediaries between cultivators and the state, extending earlier attempts of Warring States to establish direct link between ruler and subjects
* Registers listed members of groups of five and ten who bore mutual responsibility should one commit a crime
* Minister Shang divided Qin society into interlocking units, (smallest were five and ten households); these units formed larger units of county (xian) which provided local government’s services
* County officials organized the army, carried out public works, collected taxes, and administered justice; the state reached from the county and reached down to the lowest unit of land (individual’s field)
