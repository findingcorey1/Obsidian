School of Thoughts Confucianism
* Karl Jaspers called the centuries around 500 BCE the “Axial Age” – they formed as axis around which history turned: “Man, as we know him today, came into being
* Axial Age writings: Confucian and Daoist texts in the East, Buddhist and Jain documents in South Asia, the Greek philosophy and the Hebrew Bible (with its descendants the New Testament and the Koran) in the Mediterranean

* Confucianism: The Four Books and Five Classics are the authoritative texts of Confucianism before 300 BCE
	* Four Books: Great Learning ( 大學 Da xue), Doctrine of the Mean ( 中庸 Zhongyong), Analects ( 論語 Lunyu), Mencius ( 孟子 Mengzi)
	* Five Classics: Book of Poetry ( 詩經 Shijing), Book of Documents ( 尚書 Shujing), Book of Rites ( 禮記 Liji), Book of Changes ( 易經 Yijing), Spring and Autumn Annals ( 春秋 Chunqiu)
* Confucianism is credited with having authored or edited many of the classical texts
* Confucius (551-479 BCE): born in Qufu, Shandong province, Lu state during Spring and Autumn period
* Lu took pride with Zhou heritage, as its lords (dukes) were descendants of Duke of Zhou’s brother, but in the 6th century BCE these traditions were undermined when powerful warlord families took over government, marginalizing the ducal house (similar thing happened with Zhou dynasty with the rise of powerful states) 
* Confucius was born to a man who had the rank of knight (man of service) – the lowest rank in nobility (served as an aid to major aristocratic family)
* Confucius’ mother was a concubine and he grew with her family (he was three when his father died)
* As a young man, Confucius held low-ranking positions managing accounts and watching over livestock

* Confucius began a career as a tutor to young men who wanted to learn art of governance; he was also seeking a position as advisor to a ruler (perhaps attained such position in his native Lu)
* His mastery of Zhou cultural forms allowed Confucius to become a teacher of young aristocrats seeking polish, and through their connections, he was able to gain some stature in Lu
* He and some of his followers attempted to implement a grand restorationist plan in Lu that would have shifted power back to the ducal house
* Shortly after 500 BCE, when Confucius was about fifty, the plan failed, and Confucius was forced to leave his home state
* For about fifteen years, he traveled with a retinue of disciples from state to state in eastern China, looking for a ruler who would employ him and adopt the policies he advocated
* After traveling to several polities he returned to Lu where he taught until his death in 479 BCE, training young men in the literary, ritual, and musical arts that he saw as central to the culture of the Zhou
* Three themes of Confucius’ time were:
	* 1) warfare, which had been pervasive among the feudal lords since the devolution of power into their hands;
	* 2) the further devolution of power from the Zhou-appointed feudal houses into the hands of subordinate families that managed to accumulate power locally;
	* 3) and the rising fluidity of social mobility which this type of open competition for power encouraged, as intelligence and warrior skills in their assistants proved more valuable to competing power-holders than did hereditary pedigree
* Confucius emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity
* His followers competed with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of Thought era (6th-3rd centuries BCE), and were suppressed in favour of the Legalists during the Qin Dynasty
* During Han dynasty, Confucius’ teaching received official endorsement and was further developed into a system known as Confucianism
*  Confucius lived at a time before circulated books were written, his conversations were at first orally transmitted and then written by his students (and their students) – The Analects (“discussions and conversations” or “arranged discourses)
* The Analects is the main source for understanding Confucius’ teaching
* Confucius liked talking and spent most of his life in conversations
* Confucius claimed that he did not introduce new ideas, rather, he was seeking to return the disordered realm to earlier time
* The Master sought to end the warfare if his time by restoring the Zhou dynasty in Lu
* <u>Eleventh-century-BCE Duke of Zhou was his model of virtue</u>; to restore the moral excellence of the duke’s time by reinstating the system of ritual (the lineage of dukes of Lu had begun with the brother of Duke of Zhou) 
* Archeology suggests that Confucius knew rather little about the distant duke’s era
* It was not the duke but a much later ritual revolution around 850 BCE that had given restrained, carefully graded rites, assigning all members of a broad elite to places in hierarchy
* Around 600 BCE rituals had changed again as a few super powerful men began being buried with huge wealth, setting themselves above the rest of the elite
* Treasuring Zhou traditions with which he was associated, after the decline of the Zhou royal house the state of Lu had become known as the purest repository of Zhou aristocratic culture
* But during the 6th century, these traditions of Zhou were undermined, as powerful warlord families gained increasing control of government and resources in Lu, gradually marginalizing the legitimate ducal house, and distorting the norms of government form and ceremonial ritual that had made Lu distinct
* Confucius, educated but not particularly rich shi (gentry scholar), was probably reacting to the second change, idealizing the stable ritual order that flourished between 850 and 600 BCE and projecting it back onto the Duke of Zhou
* To follow the ritual meant to practice humanness (ren): caring more about the living family than about ancestors; valuing honest reverence over showy sanctimony; esteeming virtue, not descent; performing rituals accurately and with simple equipment; and following precedent
* But Confucius innovated: he taught students how to behave virtuously and how to govern; in the antiquity, it was believed that sons of high-ranking families were born with that knowledge
* Confucius introduced something new in the concept of ritual: his contemporaries used the term for specific rituals, while Confucius recognized abstract quality common to them that applied to the forms of social interactions
* If men could learn to employ this quality, society could be reformed
* The ritual (li 礼 )offered the best opportunity for individual to develop his own humanness (ren 仁 ) – an essential quality which is also translated as “benevolence”, “perfect virtue”, “goodness”, “exemplary humanity” and “manhood at its best”
* The reasons why rituals work involve several different elements: one theme is that of refinement – through the practice of ritual, humans refine their dispositions such that they learn to respond to situations in ways that help those around them be better human being
* Through rituals: movement from dispositions (nature) to propriety – responding to things properly, instead of by immediate disposition
* A second recurring theme is one of extension: this involves taking certain patterns of behavior or particular dispositions and extending them into other domains
* Rituals allow one to take feelings one has for immediate kin and extend these to strangers and aspects of the natural world
* Practitioners thus come to see ghosts as ancestors and see the ruler as both father and mother, as well as the Son of Heaven
* Therefore, in what was once a world of competing families, in a cosmos perceived to be at best indifferent to humanity and perhaps governed by capricious spirits, rituals create a world in which humans come to think of the entire cosmos as a family
