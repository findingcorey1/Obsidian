School of Thoughts Confucianism
* Karl Jaspers called the centuries around 500 BCE the “Axial Age” – they formed as axis around which history turned: “Man, as we know him today, came into being
* Axial Age writings: Confucian and Daoist texts in the East, Buddhist and Jain documents in South Asia, the Greek philosophy and the Hebrew Bible (with its descendants the New Testament and the Koran) in the Mediterranean

* Confucianism: The Four Books and Five Classics are the authoritative texts of Confucianism before 300 BCE
	* Four Books: Great Learning ( 大學 Da xue), Doctrine of the Mean ( 中庸 Zhongyong), Analects ( 論語 Lunyu), Mencius ( 孟子 Mengzi)
	* Five Classics: Book of Poetry ( 詩經 Shijing), Book of Documents ( 尚書 Shujing), Book of Rites ( 禮記 Liji), Book of Changes ( 易經 Yijing), Spring and Autumn Annals ( 春秋 Chunqiu)
* Confucianism is credited with having authored or edited many of the classical texts
* Confucius (551-479 BCE): born in Qufu, Shandong province, Lu state during Spring and Autumn period
* Lu took pride with Zhou heritage, as its lords (dukes) were descendants of Duke of Zhou’s brother, but in the 6th century BCE these traditions were undermined when powerful warlord families took over government, marginalizing the ducal house (similar thing happened with Zhou dynasty with the rise of powerful states) 
* Confucius was born to a man who had the rank of knight (man of service) – the lowest rank in nobility (served as an aid to major aristocratic family)
* Confucius’ mother was a concubine and he grew with her family (he was three when his father died)
* As a young man, Confucius held low-ranking positions managing accounts and watching over livestock

* Confucius began a career as a tutor to young men who wanted to learn art of governance; he was also seeking a position as advisor to a ruler (perhaps attained such position in his native Lu)
* His mastery of Zhou cultural forms allowed Confucius to become a teacher of young aristocrats seeking polish, and through their connections, he was able to gain some stature in Lu
* He and some of his followers attempted to implement a grand restorationist plan in Lu that would have shifted power back to the ducal house
* Shortly after 500 BCE, when Confucius was about fifty, the plan failed, and Confucius was forced to leave his home state
* For about fifteen years, he traveled with a retinue of disciples from state to state in eastern China, looking for a ruler who would employ him and adopt the policies he advocated
* After traveling to several polities he returned to Lu where he taught until his death in 479 BCE, training young men in the literary, ritual, and musical arts that he saw as central to the culture of the Zhou
