**The Six Dynasties, Buddhism and Sui Dynasty**

**Six Dynasty Period (220-589)**

• In 192, Cao Cao (155-220) became regent, but he managed to gain only one-third of Han territory.

• As power brokers squabbled using Han emperor Xiangdi as a pawn, the empire broke down into fiefdoms, the Xiongnu and Qiang took over frontiers.

• Seeing how landlords were undermining the state, Cao Cao tried to solve the military problem by settling his soldiers in colonies, and the political problem by classifying the gentry into nine ranks, determining their position in a meritocracy.

• Cao Cao was cutting the magnates out of power, and until 208, when his navy was wiped out at the battle of Red Cliff, it looked as if Cao would pull China together again.

• After the battle of Red Cliffs, a balance developed among three main warlords, and after 220, the country developed into three kingdoms – Wei, Shu and Wu.

**The Three Kingdoms, 262 CE**

• In 220, Cao Cao’s son Cao Pi forced the symbolic Han emperor Xiangdi to abdicate and proclaimed himself the founder of new dynasty (Wei) in the north.

• Wei was always the strongest among the three kingdoms, it crushed rivals in 264, renamed itself Jin dynasty and in 280 raised huge army and fleet that finished conquering China.

• Jin collapsed as Xiongnu conquered the former capital Luoyang in 311 and Changan in 316.

• The court and refugees fleeing Changan founded Eastern Jin at Jiangking (Nanjing) in 317.

• New and unstable states were forming in the north – Sixteen Kingdoms of the Five Barbarians.

• **Northern Dynasties**

• Northern Wei (386–534) – founded by the Tuoba (Tabgach), a Xianbei (proto-Mongolic) people.

• Eastern Wei (534–550) – also Xianbei-led, a continuation of Northern Wei after its division.

• Northern Zhou (557–581) – ruled by another Xianbei clan, though increasingly sinicized.

• **Six dynasties – Han Chinese**

• Eastern Wu (222–280); Eastern Jin (317–420) – northern refugees after invasions; Liu Song (420–479); Southern Qi (479–502); Liang (502–557); Chen (557–589).

• Northern Wei dynasty (386-534) was established by nomadic tribe Xienbei (Tabgach) which was part of Xiongnu confederacy.

• Tuoba Gui took power in 386 and assumed the title of emperor in 396; capital at Pinhcheng, northern Shanxi.

• Some of the Tabgach were drawn in Chinese ways; those who married the children to Chinese clans gave birth to a mixed aristocracy.

• Empress Dowager Feng (after the emperor died in 465) was a member if this aristocracy.

• In 477 series of measures to transform Tabgach tribal rule into a Chinese bureaucracy.

• Land reform in 485 of equal-field system: the state awarded land (forty third-acres) to all those of tax-paying age; when boy reached eleven, he was eligible for half a grant; he received the rest when he became fifteen.

• Emperor Xiaowen (reigned 471-499) moved the capital in Luoyang and launched series of measures to make the empire Chinese.

• Adopting Chinese names, clothing, speak Chinese in court; ranking Tabgach families according to nine-grade system (similar to Cao Cao’s system) that determined which offices they could hold.

• Sinification may have masked a move against the military which retained significant power in Northern Wei, as the Chinese model granted the emperor more power than did the traditional power-sharing policies of the steppe.

• After Emperor Xioamen’s death the dynasty entered three decades of discord; the government lost control of northern border armies and the dynasty came to an end in 534 in the hands of military leaders.

• In the south: Southern Qi (479-502) and Liang dynasty (502-587).

**Buddhism**

• Long-term political instability during the Six Dynasty period marked the centuries of China’s conversion to Buddhism.

• From its inception Buddhism was associated with trade; in his attempts to win followers, Gautama Buddha (ca. 500 BCE) focused on cities rather than the countryside, for there he found merchants who could provide financial support.

• A statue of the Buddha from Sarnath, 4th century.

• The earliest Buddhists (foreign merchants from Central Asia and India) arrived in Luoyang in the 1st century CE.

• These traders established small self-contained communities which remained isolated from the Chinese.

• During the 2nd and 3rd centuries, many Chinese worshiped Buddha and deified Laozi at the same time; like the deified Laozi Buddha was thought to have attained immortality.

• Despite its foreign origin Buddhism won more followers than Daoism.

• Religion and trade remained intertwined along the Silk Road; Buddhist monks traveled on merchants ships in the company of merchants who paid their trips.

• Monasteries could not survive without presence of large business communities who made donations in the hope of transferring merit to themselves and their descendants.

• The two-way flow of goods between India and China supported the Buddhist clerics, and Buddhist texts urged devotees to demonstrate their faith by donating what the Chinese and Indian merchants traded (silk from China, gems, precious stones, glass, and relics from India).

• Barriers in accepting Buddhism: chastity required family-loving Chinese to live in monasteries to forgo marriage and continue their family line; the texts were written in Sanskrit.

• Difficulties in accepting the Buddhist concept of karma (literally “action”) among the Chinese; every individual is constant flux: one is constantly changing product of all of one’s actions (as one changes from day to day, one’s essence changes on death too).

• Depending on what one had done in the course of life (intentions and actions) and all of previous existences, one can be reborn as an animal or a person.

• This view of soul constantly in flux ran counter to the traditional Chinese view that one’s self remained constant, even when traveling to underworld (one traveled to underworld in one’s own body).

• But Buddhism offered a far more optimistic view of the after life than the indigenous Chinese view of harsh underworld jails for most of the dead (and the realm of immortals preserved just for a few).

• Early sources state that Buddha could fly from one place to another and that he emitted light; the belief in miracles underlay many early conversions in China.

• During the first centuries of Buddhism – Lesser Vehicle (Hinayana): nirvana (salvation) was possible only for those who joined the Buddhist clergy; discouraged the worship of Buddhist images; regarded Buddha as a great teacher, but very much a human being.

• By the time of Kamarajiva (334-417) – a Buddhist monk, scholar and translator who settled in Changan – Buddhists in India and China subscribed to beliefs which they called the Greater Vehicle (Mahayana).

• The Greater Vehicle (Mahayana) offered salvation even to those who remained in the laity (believers); encouraged the building of massive images; regarded Buddha as a divine being capable of great miracles.

• By year 600, China had become a predominantly Buddhist country with thousand of monasteries.

• One of the major reasons for Buddhists’ success was that they were willing to absorb elements of preexisting religions and beliefs.

• Buddhist missionaries assimilated local deities as guardians; in early years; they also drew on Daoist vocabulary to introduce their teachings.

• The populace saw no contradiction in continuing to worship Buddhist, Daoist, and local deities at the same time.

• Local kings patronized Buddhists rather than Daoists in the hope of fulfilling the ideal of _cakravartin_ (“wheel-turning”) king who governed well because if his pious acts.

• Local rulers sponsored construction of large imperial monasteries and translation of Buddhist texts into Chinese.

• Buddhism offered non-Chinese rulers (like Xiongnu ruler Shi Le who conquered Luoyang) an alternative to Confucianism, which empowered literate Chinese officials.

• Even during the difficult years of Northern Wei, Buddhist establishments continued to receive unprecedented support from different factions vying for power.

• In 518, the prince of Northern Wei complained, “Today there is no place that does not have Buddhist sanctuary”.

• Many of these monasteries were built in the years after 500.

• Three types of monasteries existed during Northern Wei; the state built the largest ones such as Monastery of Eternal Peace (which housed officially ordained monks and conducted all official observances for the emperor).

• Royal princes and high-born families built another 839 monasteries which also enjoyed steady income.

• The third category comprised the small chapels and shrines (30,000) throughout the countryside whose only income came commoners and whose clergy was not officially ordained.

**Sui**

• ca 580 CE.

• In 589, Sui reunified China and ruled for three decades, and Sui was succeeded by the Tang, who ruled for nearly three centuries.

• In 581, Yang Jian (born to a powerful military family) seized power of Northern Zhou and began reign of Sui dynasty as Emperor Wen.

• Emperor Wen abolished the anti-Han policies of Zhou and reclaimed his Han surname of Yang.

• He won the support of Confucian scholars who held power in previous Han dynasties (abandoning the nepotism and corruption of the nine-rank system).

• In 588, the Sui had amassed 518,000 troops along the northern bank of the Yangtze River, stretching from Sichuan to the East China Sea.

• By 589, Sui troops entered Jiankang (Nanjing) and the last emperor of Chen surrendered; the city was razed to the ground, while Sui troops escorted Chen nobles back north.

• Sui conquered and unified China, but like Qin, Sui did not rule for long.

• The people of the North and the South had grown apart, and the influence of Turko-Mongol population was much stronger in the north than in the more refined aristocratic south.

• Emperor Wen was famous for bankrupting the state treasury with warfare and construction projects, but he made many improvements to infrastructure during his early reign.

• He established granaries as sources of food and as a means to regulate market prices from the taxation of crops.

• One of the major work projects undertaken by the Sui was construction activities along the Great Wall; but this, along with other large projects, strained the economy.

• Emperor Yang of Sui (569–618) ascended the throne after his father’s death, possibly by murder.

• He further extended the empire, but unlike his father Wen, he did not seek to gain support from the nomads; instead, he restored Confucian education and the Confucian examination system for bureaucrats.

• The Sui dynasty canal (the Grand Canal) linked a series of preexisting waterways and harnessed several rivers to make a link between the Sui capital and the gran producing areas in the south.

• Emperor Yang (r. 604-618).

• Both Emperors Wen and Yang sent military expeditions into Vietnam, as Annam in northern Vietnam had been incorporated into the Chinese empire over 600 years earlier during the Han dynasty (the Kingdom of Champa in central Vietnam became a major counterpart to Chinese invasions to its north).

• Campaign to the north against the eastern Turks and against Koguryo to the east.

• In 580, the Sui founder rescinded the ban on Buddhism (and Daoism) by the previous Northern Zhou dynasty.

• During the ban, many devotees had resolved to protect the teachings of Buddha, knowing that the authorities’ support for Buddhism would remain inconstant.

• They believed they were witnessing a sign of shift to the Final Age of the Doctrine when all religious life would disappear (only after the world had been destroyed would a new Buddha come to the earth).

• The Sui founder became grand donor to Buddhism who built a national network of monasteries and ordered the chanting of Buddhist prayers during the three months of the Buddha’s birthday.
