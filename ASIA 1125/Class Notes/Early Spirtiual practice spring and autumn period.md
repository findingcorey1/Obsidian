* Early Chinese religious practices during the Warring States period and Han dynasty (5th century BCE – 1st century CE)
* Humans were believed to be composed by numerous energies, souls and powers
* Some forms of qi (氣) were associated with human emotions, while the souls - the hun (魂, the yang soul – mind and heaven) and po (魄, the yin soul – body and earth) - were linked to aspects of personality
* The hun (魂) and po (魄) represented a dual conception of the soul reflecting the broader yin–yang cosmology that was emerging in early Zhou thought
* Another vital component of the human being was the spirit (shen, 神), which endowed humans with consciousness and awareness
* While alive humans would try to cultivate these energies and their spirit and keep them within human body
* When humans die, these energies and spirit would leave the body
* ==The recently deceased ghosts tend to be overwhelmed by energies associated with jealousy, anger and resentment directed at the living, partially because they were still alive; the spirit freed from the body would become more powerful==
* This results in dangerous ghosts or demons which tend to haunt the living
* Fortunately for the living, the energies of anger and resentment dissipated over time; with this the spirit grew even more powerful and more distant from the living and increasingly roam in the heavens above
* The heavens were filled with other spirits (shen) as well, including various nature spirits, and most importantly, with Heaven itself (also called the Di – God) which many saw as the most powerful deity
* Shangdi (上帝) or Di is a supreme god and sky deity in Chinese traditional religions; he was also identified as Tian (天) - Heaven, Universe
* As the spirit of the deceased shed more of the elements which held it down to earth (body and souls of personality) it became like other spirits in the heavens – more powerful than the ghosts but also distant and potentially indifferent to humans
* Such indifference could be dangerous, since the spirits controlled things like weather
* The spirits could be capricious because they were relatively unengaged with persons (not because they were filled with anger like the recently deceased ghosts), so they could send rain or drought regardless of the needs of people
* Humans had tendencies to be both resentful and/or indifferent toward other humans; there was a view of death that energies that would make up ghosts and spirits were already within the living human
* ==Rituals were attempts to domesticate (cultivate) humans and help them forge better relationships with each other, and rituals dealing with ghosts and spirits equally involved attempts to domesticate them and draw them into webs of relationships with humans==
* The problem was clear: humans had to deal with recently deceased ghosts and powerful spirits
* Hence the goal of early Chinese practice was to transform these figures as much as possible, or at least to forge relationships with them – such that they become more responsive to the needs of the living humans
* For the recently deceased the main concern was to separate the personality of the deceased from the spirit
* ==Ritual actions would be taken to keep the souls with the body when the deceased is buried in a tomb – the goal would be to keep the souls in the tomb removed from the living==
* ==Ritual exhortations so that the souls don’t leave the tomb; also by making the tomb a place which the souls would want to remain (thus things associated with person in life like food, texts, etc., would be placed in the tomb)==
* Hence the souls would be tempted to stay in the tombs, not rejoin the spirits and not attack the living
* Further destiny of souls was less clear: they could dissipate over time or might be reborn in various paradises (in western paradises associated with Xiwangmu for instance)
* ==The fate of the spirit would be different: the living would undertake ritual actions to transform the spirit into ancestor==
* The spirit would be given tablet in the ancestral hall, a temple name, and defined time for sacrifices, based on the place in the ancestral lineage, not on the personality of the person (which the living hoped to be kept separate, in the tomb)
* At the proper ritual moments the spirits would be called down from heavens to enter the temple and to be sacrificed to as ancestor, then called on to act like ancestor and treat the living as descendants who should be supported
* ==If successful, this would mean that the spirit, cleared from the energies and souls that could be dangerous, would become supportive ancestor using its power to act on behalf of the living (domestication of the spirits)==
* The separation of the souls from the spirit and converting the spirit into ancestor is not always successful; for the recently deceased the spirit could link up with the souls and energies and thus become dangerous ghosts and the more distant ancestors tend to become indifferent to the needs of the living
* Therefore the sacrifices had to be given repeatedly because the process was never complete
* Rulership: in early dynasties the lineage in control would always seek the support of the highest divinity – Di for Shang and Heaven for Zhou
* The prevailing view was that the more a divine power was removed from earth, the stronger that power was – thus Di/Heaven was not only powerful but also difficult to sway with human ritual
* Even the spirits of long deceased humans were powerful but insofar they were far removed from the living they were also difficult to control
* To effect change in divine powers, therefore, one always should begin with the most recently deceased; these are the least powerful  but (and highly capricious) most pliable by living humans
* The goal was to use sacrifice to transform the recently deceased spirits into ancestors who the would be called upon in support of their descendants
* For the royal lineage, then, the goal was to transform the spirits into ancestors who would then be called on to ascend and serve the highest divinity Heaven/Di
* When King Wu of Zhou conquered the Shang, he called upon his deceased father, King Wen, to serve the high god
* With each passing generations sacrifices would be given to the most recently deceased ancestors who would be called to serve the next highest in the lineage, all the way up to these ancestors who would be called upon to serve Heaven
* In such a sacrificial system, however, there was inherent tendency of decline: each subsequent generation would grow ever more distant from the ancestors serving Heaven; the rulership would change hands – new dynasty
* As the Zhou declined, however, no clan succeeded in overthrowing it; the realm fell in disarray and in de facto independent states vying for dominance
* By the 4th and 3rd century BCE emergence of centralized forms of statecraft in some of these states; these institutions aimed at undercutting the power of aristocratic lineages that controlled the political life during the Bronze Age
* The goal was to create military and bureaucratic systems that would promote those who were born beneath the aristocracy
* This trend reached its climax in 221 BCE when Qin conquered the rest of the kingdoms and created an empire
* The Qin ruler invented new title – Huangdi (August God) and he proclaimed himself the First August God or Shi Huandi; he was to be followed by Second August God, and so on for ten thousand generations
* The sense was that Qin was not simply another dynasty supplanting the Zhou (and in turn to be supplanted by another lineage); it was rather indented to be an empire that would continue forever
* For this purpose Qin ruler started policy of undercutting the power of lineages throughout the realm; the commanders were commanded by officials directly appointed by the court; direct control of land and recourses by Qin (instead by powerful lineages)
* The First Emperor changed the sacrificial system – personally offered sacrifices in local areas, which entailed direct control over areas instead of yielding to local lineages
* The goal was not to bring the spirits in the pantheon with the ruling lineage on top (like during Zhou)
* The claim was that the ruler was personally strengthened by the encounter with the spirits; expansion of empire and control of sacrificial sites
* The result of such procession would be gradual divinization of the ruler and his ascension into heavens as a god; as a god he would not be dependent on sacrifices of the living to transform him into ancestor
* The empire would not be dependent upon serving Heaven and calling upon Heaven to preserve the imperial lineage, since, as a god, he would intervene directly on behalf of those below
* The First Emperor was asserting a divine rulership; he did not claim divine descent, for in the beginning he would be fully human  but he would transform into divine immortal though sacrificial practices
* Then the ruler would be completely independent from the system of genealogical relationships that defined Zhou
* In the previous sacrificial order the founding king would be made ancestor serving the Heaven until he was replaced by a new founder
* The First Emperor would ascend to Heaven and reside there permanently; the empire would be ruled by his descendants for eternity
* The First Emperor was not a god on earth, but he would be god in the heavens
* But the Qin fell only few years after the death of First Emperor
* The centralized imperial system and the sacrificial system of Qin were revived by Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty
* The sacrificial system under Wu involved divinization of the ruler, resulting in ultimate ascension, as well as symbolic claim for the personal control over all sacrificial sites and the territories they were found
* In the subsequent decades, however, the state suffered from imperial overreach and the system became under attack in the 30s BCE and calls for return to the  ritual system of Zhou (making the recently deceased into ancestors and then using this for defining ruler’s relationships with other families and to the high god in genealogical terms)
* Ultimately, in 31 BCE the system of Qin and Wu was changed, based on reading of Book of Rites
* The ruler was defined as human and again was referred as Son of Heaven – defined in ritual terms not as descent
* The emphasis turned again to a form of control of decentralized system of governance using ritual claims of contracted genealogies to gain support
* Book of Rites (Liji) would become very influential text and be defined as one of the Five Classics
* Crucial steps were taken in defining the classical form of Chinese kingship – the ruler as a human
* The classical concept of sovereignty took shape during the Qin and Han periods (221 BCE – 220 CE)
* While the sovereign adopted the titles connoting supreme power huangdi – emperor, he was never considered divine, at least when he was alive, nor was he considered incarnation of divine being
* Rather, he was considered “unique man” representing Heaven’s will on earth and serving as a link between heaven and earth
* The notion of Son of Heaven was not related to the genealogical conception of kingship (that the king was descendant of a certain god or the god incarnate like in Egypt or Japan) – the emperor was earthly representative of Heaven or heavenly will, not a descendant from Heaven
* Monarchy was hereditary but would only be maintained within a given lineage as long as that lineage was seen to serve his duties properly; when he was not doing his job, the lineage would be overthrown and replaced by another
* Claims of divine kingship were very strong in early China
* Even though such claims were disputed, they played a crucial role in the development of imperial rulership
