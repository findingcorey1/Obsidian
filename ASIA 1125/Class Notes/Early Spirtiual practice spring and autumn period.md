* Early Chinese religious practices during the Warring States period and Han dynasty (5th century BCE – 1st century CE)
* Humans were believed to be composed by numerous energies, souls and powers
* Some forms of qi (氣) were associated with human emotions, while the souls - the hun (魂, the yang soul – mind and heaven) and po (魄, the yin soul – body and earth) - were linked to aspects of personality
* The hun (魂) and po (魄) represented a dual conception of the soul reflecting the broader yin–yang cosmology that was emerging in early Zhou thought
* Another vital component of the human being was the spirit (shen, 神), which endowed humans with consciousness and awareness
* While alive humans would try to cultivate these energies and their spirit and keep them within human body
* When humans die, these energies and spirit would leave the body
* The recently deceased ghosts tend to be overwhelmed by energies associated with jealousy, anger and resentment directed at the living, partially because they were still alive; the spirit freed from the body would become more powerful
* This results in dangerous ghosts or demons which tend to haunt the living
* Fortunately for the living, the energies of anger and resentment dissipated over time; with this the spirit grew even more powerful and more distant from the living and increasingly roam in the heavens above
* The heavens were filled with other spirits (shen) as well, including various nature spirits, and most importantly, with Heaven itself (also called the Di – God) which many saw as the most powerful deity
* Shangdi (上帝) or Di is a supreme god and sky deity in Chinese traditional religions; he was also identified as Tian (天) - Heaven, Universe
* nAs the spirit of the deceased shed more of the elements which held it down to earth (body and souls of personality) it became like other spirits in the heavens – more powerful than the ghosts but also distant and potentially indifferent to humans
* Such indifference could be dangerous, since the spirits controlled things like weather
* The spirits could be capricious because they were relatively unengaged with persons (not because they were filled with anger like the recently deceased ghosts), so they could send rain or drought regardless of the needs of people
* Humans had tendencies to be both resentful and/or indifferent toward other humans; there was a view of death that energies that would make up ghosts and spirits were already within the living human
* Rituals were attempts to domesticate (cultivate) humans and help them forge better relationships with each other, and rituals dealing with ghosts and spirits equally involved attempts to domesticate them and draw them into webs of relationships with humans
* The problem was clear: humans had to deal with recently deceased ghosts and powerful spirits
* Hence the goal of early Chinese practice was to transform these figures as much as possible, or at least to forge relationships with them – such that they become more responsive to the needs of the living humans

nFor the recently deceased the main concern was to separate the personality of the deceased from the spirit

Ritual actions would be taken to keep the souls with the body when the deceased is buried in a tomb – the goal would be to keep the souls in the tomb removed from the living
