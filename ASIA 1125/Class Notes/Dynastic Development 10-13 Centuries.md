I. Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127)

- The dynasty was founded by General Zhao Kyungyin, who served under the Later Zhou regime, whose capital was Kaifeng.
- In 960, Zhao Kyungyin overthrew the boy ruler and unified the empire, ruling as Emperor Taizu (960–976).
- Taizu conquered the middle Yangze in 963 and Sichuan in 965.
- After Taizu's death, his brother continued unification, conquering Jiangsu and Zhejiang in 978 and Shanxi in 979.
- The Song faced steady fiscal pressure due to the pressure from the northern border.
- The government had to pay high annual indemnity charges to regimes in the north.
- Defense expenditure in 1065 required money for the army (1.25 million troops) and consumed 83% of the state's annual cash income.

II. Government and Recruitment

- Recruitment in government occurred.
- Military governors, who had been powerful after 755, were replaced with civil officials.
- The use of civil service examinations had been increasing steadily since the 7th century.
- During the Song, civil examinations became the primary means of recruiting officials.
- The Tang practice of appointing officials based on recommendation died out during the Song.
- The Song dynasty supported a widespread postal service modeled on the earlier Han dynasty system for fast communication.

III. Commercial Revolution and Finance

- The Commercial Revolution saw the introduction of the world’s first paper money.
- Money circulated in both cities (used year-round by urban residents) and the countryside (used seasonally by many farmers).
- Agricultural Specialization and Markets:

- At the start of the market revolution, most cultivators were self-sufficient, typically only buying salt.
- By the end of the revolution, cultivators specialized, growing cash crops, making handicrafts, or weaving cloth for market, using proceeds to buy their food.
- A national market developed where specific goods were traded across Song territory.
- Markets expanded beyond government-designated commercial areas; merchants piled wares on every street, and markets appeared in every village.

- Development of Paper Money:

- The world’s first paper money emerged in Sichuan.
- Sichuan remained a separate currency zone after unification.
- Facing a bronze coin shortage, the government required only iron coins in Sichuan.
- Iron was too bulky to serve as currency (e.g., 28 g. of silver was equivalent to 40 kg. of iron).
- In response to the chaotic currency situation (which included peasant rebellions in the late 10th century), Sichuanese merchants developed paper money to facilitate long-distance transactions.
- Local people deposited iron with merchant houses and used the deposit slips as promissory notes.
- This paper money gradually replaced the cumbersome strings of iron coins.
- The region of circulation expanded to include all of north China by the end of the 11th century.
- The initial paper money offering was backed by a 29% cash reserve, but backing percentages shrank on later issues, leading to inflation.
- Because merchants occasionally failed to pay the value of the notes, the government proposed trading paper money in every three years, but the regulations were relaxed, leading to longer circulation periods.

IV. Political Reforms and Factions (Post-1068)

- Following the accession of a new emperor in 1068, the government split into two groups of officials.
- Historicists (led by Sima Guang, 1019–1086):

- Advocated for incremental reforms.
- Sima compared the successful dynasty to a house: people were the foundation, ritual and law were the pillars, and officials, generals, and soldiers were different parts.
- Maintaining the dynasty required "regular upkeep of different parts," not tearing the house down.

- Classicists (led by Chancellor Wang Anshi, 1021–1086):

- Advocated for radical reforms.
- Goal was to return to the time of pre-Confucian Sage Kings through radical reform.
- Wang argued that officials had lost the Dao (way of creating wealth).
- Wang initiated "New Policies," including those related to money.
- Wang established the Tea and Horse Agency (trading Chinese tea for Tibetan horses), where merchants were recruited, and promotions were based on money earned by officials.
- He intended to replace pay in kind by putting all government employees on cash salaries.
- Green Sprouts Reforms: Intended to relieve the chronic debt of poor peasants who struggled to repay loans for seeds.

- Wang instituted ever-level granaries that loaned grain to cultivators.
- Green Sprouts loans were provided at planting time, intended to be paid back without interest after the harvest.
- Officials undermined the program by charging 20%–30% interest.
- The most successful loans went to the rich and moneylenders (the very people the program sought to eliminate).
- Due to insufficient coinage in the countryside, peasants had to sell excessive amounts of grain to get cash to repay their loans.

V. Social Status and Gender

- Farming peasants included landowners, tenant farmers who paid rents, and serfs on large estates.
- Despite Confucian ethos placing women on a lower social tier, they enjoyed many social and legal privileges and held considerable power at home and in their small businesses.
- As society became more prosperous and parents provided larger dowries, women gained new legal rights in property ownership.
- Under certain circumstances (unmarried daughter without brothers or a surviving mother without sons), a woman could inherit one-half of her father’s share of undivided family property.
- Foot Binding:

- Emerged during the Song dynasty as a custom to enhance perceived beauty.
- The practice is thought to have begun with adult dancers in the 10th century, but mothers began binding their daughters’ feet before puberty when feet were more malleable.
- Foot binding spread during the 12th and 13th centuries as the "market in women" grew.
- The practice of men taking concubines became more common in the 12th and 13th centuries.
- Mothers bound their daughters’ feet to maximize their chances of making a prestigious marriage, as women with "perfect lotus feet" were preferred.

VI. Arts and Culture

- The arts flourished during the Song dynasty.
- Emperor Huizong (r. 1100–1126) was renowned as a painter, poet, and calligrapher, and played the guqin.
- Huizong established the Han Lin Hua Yuan (Han Lin imperial painting house) for top painters to share their works.
- Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) was a famous painter instrumental in the early history of the Chinese landscape art style known as shan shui (mountain-water), which utilized brush and ink.
- Zhang’s painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival, provides insights into life during the 11th–12th century.

VII. Neo-Confucianism

- Neo-Confucianism was a systematic reconstruction of Confucian thought using new metaphysical and ethical tools to respond to the powerful influence of Buddhism and Daoism.
- Neo-Confucian thinkers believed classical Confucianism lacked a fully developed philosophical system for addressing:

- Metaphysics (the nature of reality).
- Psychology and self-cultivation.
- Cosmology.
- Moral reasoning.

- Key figures associated with Chen-Chu Learning are Chu Hsi (1130–1200) and Chen I (1033–1107).
- Core Concepts:

- Dao (the Way) is expressed by the principle (li), which is perfect but mixed with matter (qi).
- Human nature is inherently good (li), but it is clouded by impure qi.
- Moral cultivation purifies qi and aligns human behavior with the cosmic li.

- The philosophy emphasized the preeminence of man’s pursuit of moral perfection.
- The Great Learning (eight steps for sagehood) affirmed man as a moral being and his role in the moral universe.
- Neo-Confucianism emphasized daily moral practice, self-reflection, discipline of emotions, and realizing one’s innate moral nature.
- This transformed Confucianism into a personal, inner path of self-improvement.
- The rectification of the imperial mind was crucial for national well-being and harmony between the moral universe and social order.
- Rites and rituals (Li rites, or Zhou li) are key transformatory factors, intended to recreate the ideal society established by sage kings.
- Scholar Fan Tsu-yu (11th c.) stated: "Order and disorder in the world all depend on the heart-and-mind of the ruler. If his heart-and-mind is correct, the myriad affairs of the court will be not incorrect".
