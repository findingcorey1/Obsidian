Legalism

- The Han Feizi (韓非子) is text (55 chapters, most of which date to 3rd cen. BCE) attributed to Master Han Fei: a selection of essays in the Legalist tradition on theories of state power, administration, diplomacy, war and economics
- Han Fei describes an interest-driven human nature together with the political methodologies to work with it in the interest of the state and Sovereign, namely, engaging in _wu-wei_ (passive observation)

- Crafting and use of Fa (law, measurement, statistic) to maintain leadership and manage human resources, its use to increase welfare, and its relation with justice
- Han binds programs to systematic reward and penalty (the Two Handles); the ruler minimizes his own input
- Like Shang Yang and other Fa philosophers, Han admonishes the ruler not to abandon Fa for any other means

- Han Feizi: _“If one has regulations based on objective standards and criteria and apply these to the mass of ministers, then that ruler cannot be duped by cunning fraudulence.”_

- According to the Legalists, _ren_, _jian ai_, and _dao_ all missed the point; trying to transcend reality was meaningless: godlike kings had yielded to managerial efficiency seeking ones, and the rest of us should get with the program
- For Lord Shang (fourth-century-BC prime minister of Qin), the goal was not humanness; it was “the enrichment of the state and the strengthening of military capacity” (_Fuguo Qiangbing)_

- Neither be good, nor do good, because “_A state that uses the wicked to govern the good always enjoys order and become strong_” (more Machiavellian than Machiavelli)
- If in enterprise you undertake what the enemy is ashamed to do, you have the advantage
- Waste no time on rituals, activism, and fatalism; instead draw up comprehensive law codes with brutal penalties (beheading, burial alive, hard labour) and impose them rigidly on everyone

- Legalists liked to say that like carpenter’s square laws force messy materials to conform
- Han Fei’s writings greatly influenced the First Emperor Qin, but they were officially vilified by the Han Dynasty
- Despite its outcast status throughout the history of imperial China, Han’s political theory continued to heavily influence every dynasty thereafter, and the Confucian ideal of a rule without laws was never again realized
