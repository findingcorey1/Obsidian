**Buddhism**

• Long-term political instability during the Six Dynasty period marked the centuries of China’s conversion to Buddhism.

• From its inception Buddhism was associated with trade; in his attempts to win followers, Gautama Buddha (ca. 500 BCE) focused on cities rather than the countryside, for there he found merchants who could provide financial support.

• A statue of the Buddha from Sarnath, 4th century.

• The earliest Buddhists (foreign merchants from Central Asia and India) arrived in Luoyang in the 1st century CE.

• These traders established small self-contained communities which remained isolated from the Chinese.

• During the 2nd and 3rd centuries, many Chinese worshiped Buddha and deified Laozi at the same time; like the deified Laozi Buddha was thought to have attained immortality.

• Despite its foreign origin Buddhism won more followers than Daoism.

• Religion and trade remained intertwined along the Silk Road; Buddhist monks traveled on merchants ships in the company of merchants who paid their trips.

• Monasteries could not survive without presence of large business communities who made donations in the hope of transferring merit to themselves and their descendants.

• The two-way flow of goods between India and China supported the Buddhist clerics, and Buddhist texts urged devotees to demonstrate their faith by donating what the Chinese and Indian merchants traded (silk from China, gems, precious stones, glass, and relics from India).

• Barriers in accepting Buddhism: chastity required family-loving Chinese to live in monasteries to forgo marriage and continue their family line; the texts were written in Sanskrit.

• Difficulties in accepting the Buddhist concept of karma (literally “action”) among the Chinese; every individual is constant flux: one is constantly changing product of all of one’s actions (as one changes from day to day, one’s essence changes on death too).

• Depending on what one had done in the course of life (intentions and actions) and all of previous existences, one can be reborn as an animal or a person.

• This view of soul constantly in flux ran counter to the traditional Chinese view that one’s self remained constant, even when traveling to underworld (one traveled to underworld in one’s own body).

• But Buddhism offered a far more optimistic view of the after life than the indigenous Chinese view of harsh underworld jails for most of the dead (and the realm of immortals preserved just for a few).

• Early sources state that Buddha could fly from one place to another and that he emitted light; the belief in miracles underlay many early conversions in China.

• During the first centuries of Buddhism – Lesser Vehicle (Hinayana): nirvana (salvation) was possible only for those who joined the Buddhist clergy; discouraged the worship of Buddhist images; regarded Buddha as a great teacher, but very much a human being.

• By the time of Kamarajiva (334-417) – a Buddhist monk, scholar and translator who settled in Changan – Buddhists in India and China subscribed to beliefs which they called the Greater Vehicle (Mahayana).

• The Greater Vehicle (Mahayana) offered salvation even to those who remained in the laity (believers); encouraged the building of massive images; regarded Buddha as a divine being capable of great miracles.

• By year 600, China had become a predominantly Buddhist country with thousand of monasteries.

• One of the major reasons for Buddhists’ success was that they were willing to absorb elements of preexisting religions and beliefs.

• Buddhist missionaries assimilated local deities as guardians; in early years; they also drew on Daoist vocabulary to introduce their teachings.

• The populace saw no contradiction in continuing to worship Buddhist, Daoist, and local deities at the same time.

• Local kings patronized Buddhists rather than Daoists in the hope of fulfilling the ideal of _cakravartin_ (“wheel-turning”) king who governed well because if his pious acts.

• Local rulers sponsored construction of large imperial monasteries and translation of Buddhist texts into Chinese.

• Buddhism offered non-Chinese rulers (like Xiongnu ruler Shi Le who conquered Luoyang) an alternative to Confucianism, which empowered literate Chinese officials.

• Even during the difficult years of Northern Wei, Buddhist establishments continued to receive unprecedented support from different factions vying for power.

• In 518, the prince of Northern Wei complained, “Today there is no place that does not have Buddhist sanctuary”.

• Many of these monasteries were built in the years after 500.

• Three types of monasteries existed during Northern Wei; the state built the largest ones such as Monastery of Eternal Peace (which housed officially ordained monks and conducted all official observances for the emperor).

• Royal princes and high-born families built another 839 monasteries which also enjoyed steady income.

• The third category comprised the small chapels and shrines (30,000) throughout the countryside whose only income came commoners and whose clergy was not officially ordained.
