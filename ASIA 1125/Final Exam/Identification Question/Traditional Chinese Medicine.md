Chinese Medicine

- The Chinese Medicine is based on Daoist concepts; it can be considered an offspring of Daoism in its cosmological concept
- Therapeutic practices can be traced to Shang dynasty but there was no concept of “medicine” as distinct from other fields; their oracular inscriptions on bones and tortoise shells refer to illnesses that affected the Shang royal family: eye disorders, toothaches, bloated abdomen, etc.
- The doctrines of Chinese medicine are rooted in books such as the Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon (黄帝内经Huangdi Neijing) and the Treatise on Cold Damage

- Systematization of traditional medicine started during the Spring and Autumn period and matured during Western Han
- It continued to develop during Tang – Wang Bing, a Daoist monk , and other authors complied various texts, including Inner Cannon (the contemporary version of the Inner Cannon is largely based on Wang Bin’s collection)

- Huangdi Neijing’s two main texts: the first text, the Suwen, also known as Basic Questions, covers the theoretical foundation of Chinese Medicine and its diagnostic methods
- The second and generally less referred-to text, the Lingshu (Spiritual Pivot), discusses acupuncture therapy in detail
- Song dynasty sponsored empire-wide compilation of herbal recipes
- Education in medicine was through apprenticeship; often those who failed at exams became medical practitioners

- The medicine is based on cosmological notions such as yin–yang and the five phases (elements): wood, fire, earth, metal, water
- One-qi theory – formless beginning of the world; qi becomes yin and yang; and from yin and yang – emerge five phases (stages representing dynamism of yin and yang); from the five phases come ten thousand things or the material world
- To follow nature’s law – fundamental principle: the body and cosmos are linked through cyclical dynamism of yin and yang (the five phases are material manifestation of this dynamism)

The Traditional Chinese medicine was based off on Daoist concept as it could have been considered an addition to  Daoism in the cosmological concept. Its significance can be backtracked to the Shang dynasty, at that time there were no detailed concepts of the term medicine but from inscriptions that were left from bones and turtle shells, it could tell us that many illnesses that affected the Shang royal family's included signs and symptoms of eye disorders, toothaches, bloated abdomens, etc.
