Mohism

- Mohism – Mozi ( ca 480-400 BCE) was born in Tengzhou (Shandong province), state of Lu, when Confucius was dying, and his teaching was direct response to Confucius
- The text of Mozi was written centuries later by his disciples who had divided into different groups
- Mozi borrowed many terms from Confucius but not the distinction between gentleman and a common man

- As Mozi saw it, Confucius misunderstood _ren_: it meant doing good, not being good, and was about everyone, not just for your family
- Mozi argued that each individual had an obligation toward all the other people in human society, and he advocated “impartial caring” – _jian ai_ (often mistakenly translated as “universal love”) as a solution to society’s ills
- Individuals had to consider how their actions would affect everyone in society, not just the people they knew personally

- Mozi ridiculed Confucians for advocating elaborate funerals and lengthy mourning period and yet refusing to discuss spirits and afterlife:
- Mozi: “_To maintain that there are no spirits and to study sacrificial rites is like studying the ceremonies for treating guests without having any guests_.”

- Mozi is considered the first consequentialist in ethics: evaluation of moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the welfare of a state or society
- Basic goods were order (against war and violence), material wealth (like shelter, clothing), and increase in population
- Mozi: “_It is the business of the benevolent man to seek to promote what is beneficial to the world and to eliminate what is harmful, and to provide a model for the world. What benefits he will carry out; what does not benefit men he will leave alone_.”

- The Mohists believed that morality is based on “_promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven_.”

- In the centuries following Mozi’s death, his followers battled with Confucians over the contentious issues of music, funerals, and spirits, but they all agreed that the gentleman had to remain engaged in society if he was going to reform it
- Followers of another new school of thought argued instead that the best method of reforming society was to withdraw from society – Daoism
