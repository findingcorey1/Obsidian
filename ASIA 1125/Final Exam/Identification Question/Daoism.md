Daoism

- Daoism: the _Daodejing_ - The Way and Integrity Classic is attributed as Laozi (Old Master)
- Laozi was a record keeper at the Zhou court by whose name the text is known in China
- The text took shape in the 3rd century BCE, but at that time there was no clearly identifiable group who could be called Daoists

Laozi depicted as Daode Tianzun

(the Heavenly Lord of Dao and its Virtue)

- Only in the 1st century BCE was the label Daoist attached to _Daodejing_
- At that time, Daoist referred to any teacher who practiced breathing techniques, meditation, austere eating regime in hope of extending his life span or even of gaining immortality

- Daoists disagreed with Confucius and Mozi; the Way of Universe is change: night into day, joy with sorrow, life into death
- Everything is connected to everything else; no one knows where the Way leads; we must become one with the Way, but cannot do so through fanatic activity

- The Dao is nameless, goes beyond distinctions, and transcends language
- _Daodejing_ begins as follows:

“_The ways that can be walked of are not the eternal Way;_

_The names that can be named are not the eternal name._

_It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang;_

_The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand_

_creatures, each after its kind_.”

- The _Daodejing_ advocates “female” (Yin) values, emphasizing the passive, solid, and quiescent qualities of nature (which is opposed to the active and energetic), and “having without possessing“
- Yin (“female”) and Yang (“male”) should be balanced, “Know masculinity, Maintain femininity, and be a ravine for all under heaven”
- The text praises self-gained knowledge with emphasis on that knowledge being gained with humility

- _Wuwei_, “effortless action” – spontaneity and noninterference, letting things follow their own natural course (often mistakenly translated as non-action)
- Water embodies the quality of _wuwei_, but so do too women and infants, who manage to get their desires even though they are weak

- He who governs, or the sage, should adopt the principle of allowing things to follow their natural course
- “Ruling a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish” (if one pays too much attention to the state or the small fish, it will be spoiled)
- Like the Analects, the Way of Integrity Classic looks to the past for model states

- The Daoist text targets Confucian values of sagehood, humanness, and righteousness, and Mozi’s emphasis on profit
- _Daodejing_ evokes the purity of those things that have not been touched by human hands – undyed silk and unhewn logs
- _Daodejing_ states: “_Abolish learning and you will be without worries_.”
